<p>“Industrial and Commercial South America” has been prepared,
as was the descriptive guide, “The South American
Tour,” with the desire to aid in promoting acquaintance with
South America and, as a natural sequence, friendship and
trade.</p>

<p>As far as possible the facts have been gleaned from publications
of the various Governments, in a few cases from those
of our own, from high officials of many large companies, and
from a few authoritative works. While I can hardly hope
that despite all care and effort I have made no slip anywhere,
I devoutly trust that no errors will be discovered of such magnitude
as I have often noted in my reading of important
publications and that any here detected will receive lenient
criticism.</p>

<p>The vast amount of labor involved in the collection of data
and the effort made to attain accuracy has been such that no
time remained for rhetorical embellishment unless with delayed
publication.</p>

<p>Great pains have been taken with spelling and accents, the
correct use of the latter discovered with difficulty, as they are
altogether omitted in many works and in others by no means
to be depended upon. Yet they are most important for correct
pronunciation.</p>

<p>In this text the spelling of some names varies by intention
because the two spellings are frequent and authorized, and
should therefore be familiar. Thus <i>Marowijne</i> is the Dutch
and <i>Maroni</i> the English name for the same river. So <i>Suriname</i>
is spelled with and without the <i>e</i>.</p>

<p>South American names ending in either <i>s</i> or <i>z</i> are found,
the <i>z</i> common in older publications. The <i>s</i> is a more recent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
style, taking the place of <i>z</i> even in the middle of a word. Thus
<i>Huaráz</i> is also written <i>Huarás</i> and even <i>Cuzco</i>, <i>Cusco</i>. But I
drew the line there, as <i>Cuzco</i> is too well established in English
to make the new and uglier form desirable.</p>

<p>My spelling of <i>Chilian</i> is consistent throughout. Formerly
so spelled by all, <i>Chile</i> being earlier written <i>Chili</i>, when the
Spanish form of the name was here adopted many imagined
that the adjective should be changed also. For this no reason
appears, but the contrary. The accepted ending for adjectives
of this nature is <i>ian</i>, unless euphony demands a different, as
<i>Venezuelan</i>. Where the ending <i>ean</i> is correctly employed as
in <i>Andean</i> and <i>European</i>, also <i>Caribbean</i>, which unhappily is
often mispronounced, the <i>e</i> is long and receives the accent.
This would be proper in <i>Chilean</i> as the <i>e</i> in <i>Chileno</i> receives
the accent; but as a change in our pronunciation is unlikely,
it is better to drop the final vowel and add the suffix <i>ian</i> as
is done in many other cases; thus <i>Italy</i>, <i>Italian</i>.</p>

<p>The frequent writing of <i>maté</i> in English is absolutely
wrong. It is never so printed in Spanish, though naturally in
French; but to copy their form for a Spanish word is absurd.
The word of course has two syllables, but is accented on the
first; not on the last as the written accent would imply.</p>

<p><i>Iguassú</i> in Spanish is spelled <i>Iguazú</i>, but the Portuguese
form has the right, because it is a Brazilian river, nowhere
flowing in Argentina, and for a short distance only on the
boundary. The Brazilian spelling should therefore be followed
by us, and it has the advantage that it is more apt to be correctly
pronounced.</p>

<p>Persons not undertaking the study of Spanish should at
least learn the simple rules of pronunciation; the vowels having
the ordinary continental sounds, the consonants in the main
like our own, though in the middle of a word <i>b</i> is generally
pronounced like <i>v</i>, <i>d</i> like <i>th</i> in <i>this</i> and <i>ll</i> like <i>ly</i>. The rules
for accent are easily remembered, names ending in a vowel
being accented on the penult, those in a consonant, except <i>s</i>,
<i>z</i>, and <i>n</i>, on the ultima, unless otherwise indicated by an accent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span></p>

<p>The heedlessness of many Americans on such matters is
notorious and inexcusable. Knowing the correct pronunciation
they continue to mispronounce even an easy word. A
notable illustration is Panamá, which many former residents
of the Canal Zone and others here persist in calling the ugly
<i>Pánama</i> instead of the correct and agreeable <i>Panamá</i>.
Although in English the accent is not generally used on this
word or on Colón, Panamá is repeated throughout the book
to emphasize the correct pronunciation.</p>

<p>It is hoped that other accents given will in general be found
correct. It may however be said on Brazilian authority that
the accents on Brazilian names are less important than in
Spanish.</p>

<p>A considerable divergence in the date of statistics may be
noted, for which there are several reasons. In some cases
pre-war figures, in others figures for 1917 or 1918, seem to
afford a fairer valuation; or they might be the only ones available.
Some figures (often in the nearest round number) are
given as late as 1921, but to bring all at the same time up to
the moment was quite impossible. Great difficulty has been
experienced in choosing between conflicting statements and
figures. In one case three sets of figures of areas were presented
by the same person, before I finally secured the most
accurate.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>My grateful appreciation is due and my hearty thanks are
here expressed to all who in any degree have helped by supplying
or verifying data of whatever nature. Officials of the
various countries and of many large companies evinced kindly
interest in the work and gave freely of their time, few being
too busy to afford information. The names are too numerous
to mention, but I trust that all will feel assured that their
courtesy was recognized and that the remembrance will be
cherished.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p>Our recently awakened interest in foreign trade and in
world affairs renders imperatively necessary a more accurate
knowledge of other countries and a more intimate acquaintance
with their peoples. Engaged in settling the various
sections of our own country and in developing its manifold
resources, we were too long self sufficient in thought and
narrow in our activities. Yet years ago a few far-sighted
statesmen like James G. Blaine realized that a broader field
of action would soon become essential to our continued prosperity.
A few manufacturers supplemented their domestic
business with a modicum of foreign trade. A few men of
affairs devoted their energies exclusively to the field of
foreign commerce.</p>

<p>The Spanish War, first inspiring many with the idea
that the United States had become a world power with
interests beyond its boundaries, served to arouse in others a
disposition to have a share in foreign trade. Following a
gradual increase in the early years of this century, a sudden
expansion of our commerce occurred a few months subsequent
to the outbreak of the Great War. A scarcity of shipping prevented
its attaining the proportions which might otherwise
have been realized. Now that this obstacle is removed and the
exactions of war service are over, adequate preparations should
be made for the conduct of our developing commercial relations,
especially with our Sister Continent at the south.</p>

<p>The supposition that those individuals who are directly
engaged in foreign commerce are alone benefited thereby has
unfortunately been widespread. Under our democratic form
of government it is particularly essential that all should understand
the advantages of foreign trade for the welfare of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span>
entire nation, that this may not be hampered by the narrow
views of local-thinking politicians, jealous of the prosperity of
other individuals or sections, or by persons who concern themselves
merely with the question of wages for a few or with
other special matters; and thus that our commerce may be
fostered by our Government according to the custom of other
nations, with no purpose of bitter rivalry or unfriendly greed,
but with the natural and proper desire of a great nation to
share in the mutual benefits accruing to all countries where
suitable and honorable foreign trade is developed, as in the
case of individuals who buy and sell in the home market.</p>

<p>Some knowledge of other countries and peoples, of causes
contributing to their present condition, and of their prospects
for future development, while giving intelligent interest to
trade and of service in making plans for permanent rather
than transitory gain, is desirable for all who care to rise above
ignorant narrow-minded provincialism, to be better prepared
for civic and political duties, and to enjoy a broader outlook
upon the entire world.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The most superficial observer cannot fail to perceive the
enormous advantages which have arisen from division of labor
among individuals and nations. The personal barter of primitive
days was soon superseded by a medium of exchange, fixed
locally though varying in different regions. There followed
the transport from one city to another and from distant lands
of the various products, natural or manufactured, of those
cities and countries. As many things grow only in certain
parts of the world, others we know are manufactured only in
certain districts. That in the distant future the time may come
when the entire habitable globe will be occupied, each portion
produce what is best adapted to its environment, and the fruits
of the whole earth be enjoyed by all its inhabitants, is from
the physical point of view the ideal to which we may look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</span>
forward, a goal for the attainment of which every nation may
fittingly contribute.</p>

<p>Few are the portions of the earth where it is impossible
for man to dwell, providing for his wants from his immediate
surroundings. Each section not altogether barren produces
such food and requisites for clothing as are essential to sustain
life in that locality. The only considerable portion of the
globe which is uninhabited, the Antarctic continent, seems
likely so to continue, as it appears not merely the most unattractive
spot in the world but devoid of the barest necessities
for existence.</p>

<p>The North Polar regions, however, support a few people
who live upon the products of the country and who probably
would not survive if they adopted the customs of civilization
as we regard them, though the use of a few articles which
have been carried there may slightly ameliorate their hard
existence.</p>

<p>The denizens of the tropical forest, who also have adapted
themselves to their surroundings, being able to live with little
labor, generally pursue an easy life, since necessity and ambition
for improvement are lacking.</p>

<p>In other quarters of the globe where labor is necessary to
sustain life but where its results may be a bare existence, comfort,
or luxury, man has continually struggled for improvement,
braving danger and suffering, and toiling long hours for
the future good of himself or his children. Thus has the
world made progress.</p>

<p>Here in the United States we might live in comfort with
the products of our broad lands only; yet we do not desire
to seclude ourselves within a Chinese Wall. We would enjoy
the fruits of the whole earth, not by imperialistic conquest,
but through friendly acquaintance, the sharing of ideas, and
the exchange of products.</p>

<p>Some things we produce in such abundance that we have
a superfluity to barter for others things which we produce
not at all or not in sufficient quantities. In the past we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</span>
had more trade with Europe than with other continents. In
various lines of manufactures and of artistic goods we are
still unable to compete. While east and west trade will no
doubt continue indefinitely, for natural products it would seem
that the chief exchange should be north and south, a difference
in latitude causing variety in climates, and a diversity in productions
both animal and vegetable. With our expansion of
shipping facilities following the conclusion of the War, we
may hope for a continuing increase of movement from north
to south on this hemisphere, making for friendship and political
harmony as well as for material advantage.</p>

<p>In considering South America from a commercial and
industrial point of view it is necessary to study the physical
characteristics of the individual countries, their advantages and
drawbacks; the climate and soil; the resources, including the
animal, vegetable, and mineral products, and the water power;
the character of the inhabitants including the quality and
quantity of human labor; their present needs and wants; the
future possibilities; the opportunity for investments of various
kinds and political conditions affecting these; the instruments
of exchange, banking and trade regulations; the means of
communication and transport by land and water.</p>

<p>In addition we should know the difficulties which have
retarded the development of countries settled earlier than our
own, that instead of a supercilious mental attitude on account
of real or fancied superiority in certain directions, we may
have a sympathetic understanding of conditions, and of tremendous
obstacles, some of which have been overcome in an
extraordinary manner.</p>

<p>A general view of the continent as a whole may well precede
a more detailed study of the several countries.</p>

</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Physical Characteristics</span></h4>

<p>In the study of South America one may observe certain
points of resemblance with others of difference between that
continent and North America. The outline of each, we perceive,
is roughly triangular, broad at the north and tapering
towards the south; but as the broad part of one is not far
from the Arctic Circle while that of the other is near the
equator, we find that the greater part of North America is
in the temperate zone while most of South America is in the
torrid; disparity in climate and productions follows.</p>

<p>The geological formation of the two continents is as similar
as their outline. There is a correspondence on the northeast
between what are called the Laurentian Highlands in Labrador
and the uplands of Guiana; on the southeast between the
Appalachian system of the North and the Serra do Mar of
Brazil, each having a northeast to southwest trend and a fair
similarity in height, though the tallest peak in either range is
the Itatiaiá in Brazil, which by 3000 feet exceeds Mt. Mitchel,
the highest of the Appalachians. A difference worth noting
is that the Brazilian range is closer to the sea.</p>

<p>A similarity, perhaps greater, exists in the west where lie,
close to the shore, the loftier ranges of the two continents, of
much later origin than the eastern mountains, and containing
many volcanic peaks. Each system includes several chains
with valleys or plateaus between; but in the United States the
system which includes the Rockies is wider than is that of the
Andes at any point. The two systems are distinct, having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
neither the same origin nor the same trend, while the altitude
of the South American <i>massif</i> greatly exceeds that of the
North American mountains.</p>

<p>Between the coastal regions both continents have great
basins sloping to the north, east, and south with a large river
draining each: the Mackenzie and the Orinoco flowing north,
the St. Lawrence and the Amazon east, the Mississippi and
the Paraná south. Were the two continents side by side there
would be a great resemblance in production instead of the
present considerable diversity.</p>

<p>While in area South America is ranked as smaller than
North America, it may be a trifle larger in land surface, especially
in habitable regions, if the opinion of Humboldt is correct
that the Amazon Basin will one day support the densest
population on the globe. The southern continent, comprising
no large bodies of water like Hudson Bay and our Great Lakes,
also has, save the slopes of the highest mountains, no regions
like those near the Arctic Circle, incapable of supporting more
than the scantiest population.</p>

<p>The outline of the continent is less irregular than that of
North America, consequently there are fewer good harbors,
especially on the west coast.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Climate</span></h4>

<p>As three quarters of South America lie within the tropics,
the entire north coast, and the wider part of the continent
including most of Brazil with the countries on the west as
far down as the northern part of Chile, a tropical climate and
productions might here be expected. But happily within the
torrid zone of both hemispheres are the loftiest mountain
ranges of the world. These modify the climate of large sections
to such a degree that in many places there is perpetual
spring, a perennial May or June; in other districts one may
in comparatively few hours go from regions of eternal summer
to perpetual snow, finding on the way the products of every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
clime. Thus the mountains and table-lands of South America
are effective in causing moderate temperatures over extensive
areas within the tropics, with accordant productions.</p>

<p>In comparing the climates of North and South America
we must note that while the tropical region of the latter is
much the larger, in corresponding latitudes it is in general
cooler south of the equator than north. An examination of
the isothermal lines, that is <i>the lines of equal average heat
around the globe</i>, shows:</p>

<p>First, that the line of greatest heat, a mean temperature of
85°, is north of the equator most of the way. In the Western
Hemisphere it runs well up into Central America; then it
passes along the northeast coast of South America to a point
just below the equator and the mouth of the Amazon, going
far north again in Africa.</p>

<p>Second, that of the mean annual isotherms of 65°, which
are regarded as the limits of the hot belt, the one in the Northern
Hemisphere runs 30° or more from the equator, while
that in South America hardly touches the 30th parallel, and
on the west coast approaches the equator to within 12°:
which means that the tropical region extends much farther
north of the equator than it does south.</p>

<p>Third, that of the isotherms of 50° for the warmest month,
which are considered as the polar limits of the temperate
zones, the one is much nearer to the north pole than the other
is to the south. Great masses of water, we know, have a
tendency to equalize climate, as the water heats and cools
more slowly than the land; but they do not make the average
temperature higher. From the movement of the waters of
the ocean their temperature over the globe is more nearly
equal, while the stable land of broad continental masses has
temperatures more nearly corresponding to the latitude, though
with greater daily and annual extremes. But for practical
purposes, that is for its effect on vegetation, the amount of
heat received in summer is of more consequence than the
extreme cold of winter. For this reason the temperature of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
the warmest month instead of the annual mean is taken as
the measure; for if that month’s mean temperature is below
50°, cereals and trees will not grow. The broad land masses in
the Northern Hemisphere have a greater summer heat than
the narrow stretch of land in extreme South America. The
greater cold of winter in the north temperate zone does no
harm.</p>

<p>We may observe further that in the Northern Hemisphere
the west coasts of both continents are warmer in the same
latitude than the east, at least in the temperate zone, while in
South America a good part of the west coast within the tropics
is much cooler than the east. In the temperate zone the variation
is slight.</p>

<p>In the matter of rainfall, a most important factor of climate
and production, South America is favored with a liberal supply,
the arid portions being comparatively small in area, and
many of these easily capable of irrigation and of resulting
excellent crops.</p>

<p>Dividing the continent into tropical and temperate regions,
the former includes (lowlands only) the entire north coast,
the whole of Colombia with ports on the Pacific, and Ecuador
beyond, the low interiors of Peru and Bolivia, and around on
the east the greater part of Brazil, far beyond the mouth of
the Amazon; these sections have much in common as to
climate and productions. Below Ecuador on the west coast,
though still in the torrid zone, we find cooler weather, practically
no rain, and for 1600 miles a desert region; beyond this
there is a temperate climate with gradually increasing rainfall,
and at last in southern Chile too much. On the east
coast tropical weather and products continue till we pass
Santos and the Tropic of Capricorn, followed by sub-tropical
and temperate climates and production. The mountainous
regions even at the equator have cooler weather, the temperature
ever lowering with increase of altitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Other Distinctive Features</span></h4>

<p>In general we may say that the soil is extremely fertile
and that the country contains wonderfully rich deposits of
minerals of almost every kind. The immense store of precious
metals found on this continent, some assert the greatest in any
portion of the globe, was an important factor in its settlement;
yet for true national prosperity the humbler coal and iron are
of more value. Water power is also of material service. In
these three important elements of wealth South America is not
deficient, though her resources in these lines are but slightly
developed.</p>

<p>Although many settlements were made in South America
more than half a century earlier than our first at Jamestown,
Virginia, in 1607, the population is much smaller than that of
North America, the approximate number of inhabitants being
60,000,000 for South America and 150,000,000 for North;
manifestly the development of her countries has been less
rapid. For this there are obvious reasons.</p>

<p>The tropical climate of the north coast and of much of
Brazil might seem less attractive to residents of temperate
Europe and less conducive to strenuous labor on the part of
those who came; the cooler regions of the south were more
remote than the lands of North America. Moreover, the
Spanish colony promising the greatest wealth, Peru, which at
the same time was the seat of government, was indeed difficult
of access, presenting besides, stupendous obstacles to interior
travel. In view of these facts it seems wonderful that
so many settlements were made on the west coast and that
so great a degree of culture was there maintained.</p>

<p>Growth was further hampered by heavy taxes, merciless
restrictions on trade, and other regulations by the home governments,
almost until the countries achieved their independence.
During the century of their freedom most of the
Republics have suffered from revolutions and other troubles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
but in recent years several have enjoyed a rapid development
with considerable immigration. All now present opportunities
of various kinds for investment by capitalists, for general
trade, and for other forms of business. Such opportunities,
as well as the conditions of living, vary greatly in different
countries and in localities of the same country.</p>

<p>It has long been a source of criticism on the part of the
diplomats and residents of the various Republics that in our
minds they have been lumped together; that we often refer
to those portions of the New World which were settled by
the Spanish and Portuguese as Latin America or to all save
Brazil as Spanish America. Now that we are entering upon
a period of closer relationship with our southern neighbors, it
is obviously desirable that we should differentiate among them,
learn of the diversity in productions and resources which
characterize the various countries, and something of their social
and political conditions, all of which have a bearing upon
present and prospective possibilities for commercial relations.
Therefore the countries must be studied carefully and individually.</p>

<p>So far as transportation and travel are concerned South
America is often divided broadly into three sections: the East,
the West, and the North Coasts, to which a fourth is sometimes
added, the Amazon Basin. We may begin with the
nearest, the countries on the North Coast, follow with those
on the West, and coming up from the south conclude with
Brazil. With the Republics of the North Coast we have the
greatest percentage of trade, with those on the East the largest
amount.</p>

POPULATION, ETC.</span></h3>
</div>


<p>Colombia, nearest to the United States of the republics of
South America, is recognized as one of the richest and most
beautiful of the countries of that continent, containing magnificent
scenery, with extraordinary variety and wealth of natural
resources. Colombia is noted as the first producer in the world
of platinum, emeralds, and mild coffee; the first in South
America of gold.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Area, Population, Boundary</span></h4>

<p><b>Area.</b> Colombia is fifth in size of the countries of South
America, with an area variously given, but approximately of
464,000 square miles.</p>

<p><b>Population.</b> She is probably third in population, official
figures received March, 1921, of the 1918 census being
5,847,491. 6,000,000 may be credited to her in 1921.</p>

<p><b>Boundary.</b> Colombia has the good fortune to be the
only South American country bordering upon two oceans.
Having an irregular shape, with the Isthmus of Panamá
dividing the two coasts nearly in the middle, Colombia has
the Caribbean Sea on the north and northwest for a distance
of 641 miles, and the Pacific Ocean, for a stretch of 468
miles, west of the main body of the country. Measuring
the outline of all the indentations, the coast line would be
two or three times as long. On the south are the Republics
of Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil; on the east Brazil and Venezuela.
The extreme length of the country, from 12° 24′<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
N. Lat. to 2° 17′ S., is a little over 1000 miles, as far as
from New York to St. Louis; the greatest width, from 66°
7′ to 79° W. Long., is about 800 miles.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">History</span></h4>

<p>In 1502 Columbus sailed along the northern coast, a fact
which may have prompted the inhabitants to give the country
his name. As early as 1508 Alonzo de Ojeda, who in 1499
had first touched Colombian soil, made settlements on the
coast; and in 1536 Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada explored the
interior as far as the site of Bogotá, where he founded a city
after establishing friendly relations with the aborigines.</p>

<p>The country was first named New Granada. By the middle
of the century Spanish power was fairly established along
the coast and in part of the interior. The territory was under
the authority of the Viceroy at Lima, with a local presidency,
until 1718, when a Viceroy, ruling Ecuador and Venezuela as
well, was established at Bogotá. In 1810 an insurrection broke
out against Spain, the war continuing at intervals until 1824.
During those troublous years Simón Bolívar was the chief
leader, both acting as commanding general and in 1821 becoming
President. In 1819 Bolívar had inaugurated the Great
Colombian Republic which united Venezuela and Ecuador with
New Granada; but in 1829 Venezuela withdrew and in 1830,
the year of Bolívar’s death, Ecuador also.</p>

<p>In 1831 the Republic of New Granada was established, but
disorders followed. Many changes occurred in the form of
government, which was at one time a confederation, then the
United States and now the Republic of Colombia. There
have been strife and insurrections: in 1903 that of Panamá
made the United States and its people extremely unpopular in
Colombia and for some time unfavorably affected our commercial
dealings. The adoption by the Senate of the Treaty
of Bogotá will doubtless increase the already more friendly
feeling on the part of Colombians, which can but be of value
for our investments and trade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Government</span></h4>

<p>Since 1886 Colombia has been a unitary or centralized
republic, the sovereignty of the States being abolished. The
Departments, as they are called, have Governors appointed
by the President, although each has an Assembly for the
regulation of internal affairs. Besides the Departments, there
are Territories of two varieties: Intendencias, directly connected
with the Central Government and Comisarías, sparsely
settled districts depending upon the nearest Department.</p>

<p>The President is elected for four years by direct vote of the
people. He has a Cabinet of eight members, the heads of the
various departments: the Ministers of the Interior (<i>Gobierno</i>),
Foreign Affairs (<i>Relaciones Exteriores</i>), Finance (<i>Hacienda</i>),
War (<i>Guerra</i>), Public Instruction (<i>Instrucción Pública</i>), Agriculture
and Commerce (<i>Agricultura y Comercio</i>), Public
Works (<i>Obras Públicas</i>), Treasury (<i>Tesoro</i>).</p>

<p>Instead of a Vice President two <i>Designados</i>, a first and
a second, are elected annually by Congress to act as President
in case of his death, absence from the country, or inability
to serve.</p>

<p>The National Congress consists of a Senate and a House
of Representatives. The 35 Senators are elected for four
years by persons chosen for that purpose; the 92 Representatives,
one for each 50,000 inhabitants, are elected for two years
by direct vote. Two substitutes are chosen for each Member
of Congress to replace them in case of inability to serve.
Congress meets annually at the Capital, Bogotá, July 20, for
90 to 120 days. The President may call an extra session.</p>

<p>The Judicial Branch includes a Supreme Court of nine
judges, a Superior Tribunal for each Department and a number
of minor judges.</p>

<p>Colombia has 14 Departments: four bordering on the Caribbean,
Magdalena, Atlántico, Bolívar, Antioquia; three on the
Pacific, El Valle, Cauca, Nariño; seven in the interior, Huila,
Tolima, Cundinamarca, Boyacá, Santander, Santander del<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
Norte, Caldas; Intendencias: Meta at the east; Chocó bordering
on the Caribbean and the Pacific; the Islands, San Andrés
and Providencia; six Comisarías: La Goajira, Arauca, Vichada,
Vaupés, Caquetá, Putumayo.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Population</span></h4>

<p>Colombia, ranking third of the South American Republics
in population, has about 6,000,000 inhabitants, very unevenly
distributed, as is obvious from the figures of the Departments,
already given. The average is 12 to a square mile, but in
the Departments 26 to a square mile. The smallest Department,
Atlántico, is the most densely populated, 114 to the
square mile. The largest Department, Antioquia, more than
three times the size of Massachusetts, has also the largest
population, which is reputed to be the most enterprising.</p>

<p>The character of the population is varied. According to
the Colombian statesman, Uribe, 66 per cent is composed of
pure whites and of mestizos of white and Indian and white
and negro origin, who through successive crossings during
four centuries have acquired the traits of the Caucasian race,
in some cases showing no traces of the extreme elements; the
pure Indians are 14 per cent, pure black 4 per cent, and colored
mixtures 16 per cent. The tendency is towards a closer fusion
making a unique type which will give the desired national
unification. There are about 600,000 Indians, the greater number
more or less civilized; perhaps 150,000 wild Indians, some
friendly, others hostile. How many there are in the forested
Amazon region is uncertain; the recent census places the figure
at a little over 100,000. Among all the Indians one hundred
or more different languages are spoken.</p>

<p>A great diversity in social conditions is to be expected.
A large proportion of the inhabitants dwell in the cities or
smaller towns. In a number of these may be found the culture,
dress, and refinements of European cities, splendid salons
or modest drawing rooms with equal urbanity in each. The
wants of the middle and lower classes and of the Indians would
be quite different, and would depend further upon their place
of residence; the requirements of dwellers in the tropical plains
and valleys, and of those who live on or near the bleak <i>paramos</i>
are obviously very diverse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Education</span></h4>

<p>Considerable attention is paid to education, which in the
primary grades is free but not compulsory. The percentage of
illiteracy is about 70. Bogotá has a National University with
Schools of Medicine, Law, Political Science, Engineering, and
Natural Science. Connected with it is the National Library,
an Astronomical Observatory, a School of Fine Arts, and an
Academy of Music. A free institute of learning is the Universidad
Republicana; there is also a School of Arts and
Trades, giving both general and technical instruction, as in
printing, carpentry, etc.; a <i>colegio</i> or school for secondary
instruction, La Salle Institute, the largest in Colombia, which
prepares for the University; and a Homœopathic Institute,
from which at least one woman has been graduated.</p>

<p>There are universities also at Cartagena, Popayán, Pasto,
and Medellín; in the last named city, a School of Mines, which
is a part of the National University. Elementary instruction
is the most zealously promoted in Antioquia, Caldas, Boyacá,
and Cauca; in the other Departments the school attendance is
poor. In Colombia, Spanish is spoken with greater purity than
in most of the other Republics.</p>

<p>Institutions giving instruction in agriculture, in arts and
trades, and in general science are greatly needed, as also the
teaching of sanitation and hygiene.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Press, Religion, etc.</span></h4>

<p><b>Press.</b> The Press is free, and bold in discussion.</p>

<p><b>Religion.</b> The Constitution recognizes the Roman
Catholic Religion as that of the country but permits other
forms of worship.</p>

<p><b>Telegraph.</b> The 700 telegraph offices are connected by
13,750 miles of line. Colombia has cable connection at
Buenaventura, San Andrés, and Barranquilla; wireless stations
at Santa Marta, Puerto Colombia, and Cartagena. An<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
international wireless station is expected at Bogotá in 1921.
Other stations will be at Barranquilla, Arauca, Cúcuta, Cali,
Medellín. There are 13,000 miles of telephone wire.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> For postal regulations to all the countries see <a href="#Page_459">Appendix</a>.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Money.</b> The money of Colombia approximates our own:
that is, a gold peso is worth 97.3 cents. Five pesos equal an
English sovereign. A condor is 10 pesos; a medio condor,
5 pesos, an English pound. Silver coins are 50, 40, and 10
centavos or cents; nickel coins are 1, 2, and 5 cents.</p>

<p>The <b>Metric System</b> of weights and measures is legal
and official as in all the other Republics, although to some extent
in domestic business the old Spanish measures are used;
as libra, 1.10 pound, arroba, 25 libras, quintal, 100 libras,
cargo, 250 libras. The vara, 80 centimeters, and the fanega,
about a bushel are other measures. The litre is of course
the standard of liquid measure.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br><span class="small">COLOMBIA: PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</span></h3>
</div>


<p>Colombia is called a very mountainous country, and the
most casual visitor would not dispute the statement. Mountains
are in evidence along both shores and on the way to
interior cities; but the unseen part, the hinterland, is of a
different character. Only two fifths of the country is mountainous,
but this part extremely so. In this section, very
sensibly, most of the people live, as in the neighboring countries;
for as the mountains are near the sea the majority of
the early settlers soon found their way up into the more
healthful and agreeable highlands. The chief drawback to
these is the difficulty of access; and we can not but admire the
courage and endurance of those stout-hearted people who
settled in remote places among the mountains of Colombia,
Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, and amid untold hardships there
preserved for centuries civilization and a high degree of culture.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Mountains</span></h4>

<p>The great mountain chains of Colombia constitute the
northern terminal of the great Andean system. In northern
Ecuador the Andes has become a single massive chain; but
beginning in Colombia with an irregular mass of peaks, the
mountains soon divide into three distinct ranges, the East,
West, and Central Cordilleras.</p>

<p>The <b>Central Cordillera</b> may be considered the main
range, having the highest peaks: three above 18,000 feet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
and a number nearly 16,000. Many of the summits are
crowned with eternal snow, and many are volcanoes, as are
peaks in the southern group and in the other two chains.</p>

<p>The <b>West Cordillera</b>, branching from the Central, follows
the coast line to 4° N. Lat. where it leaves a space on the
west for another coast ridge, the Serranía de Baudó, which
has come down from the north as the conclusion of the
low Panamá range and terminates the North American system.
Between this and the West Cordillera are the valleys
of the Atrato and the San Juan Rivers; the former flowing
north into the Caribbean Sea, the other south, turning into
the Pacific where the low Baudó ends. On the other (east)
side of the West Cordillera is the Cauca Valley with the
Central Cordillera beyond. These two Cordilleras end in
low hills some distance from the Caribbean coast.</p>

<p>The <b>East Cordillera</b>, with the Magdalena Valley between
that and the Central, divides into two branches: one running
far north dying out at the extremity of the Goajira
Peninsula, the other more to the east, extending into
Venezuela.</p>

<p>Curiously, along the coast of the Caribbean, northeast
of the mouth of the Magdalena, is another seemingly independent
range of mountains, detached from the East Cordillera
and quite in line with the Central: the Sierra Nevada
de Santa Marta, which has snow crowned summits rising
16,000-17,000 feet above the sea. The entire mountainous
region of Colombia is subject to earthquakes, which, however,
are less severe than those in Ecuador and Venezuela; in some
sections there are volcanic disturbances.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Plains</span></h4>

<p>Between the mountain chains, besides the narrow valleys
are limited plateau regions, the latter occupying about
900 square miles; while more than half of the country, an
immense tract east of the Andes, broadening towards the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
southern boundary, is a great plain slightly inclining
towards the east and south: the northern part belonging
to the Orinoco Basin, the larger section at the south to that
of the Amazon. This Amazon region has an area equal to
that of the entire State of California. Its higher portion,
as well as most of the Orinoco Basin in Colombia, where
there are wet and dry seasons, is composed chiefly of grassy
plains called llanos. Nearer the Amazon, where it rains a
good part of the year, the country is heavily forested.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Rivers</span></h4>

<p><b>Rivers entering the Caribbean Sea.</b> Most important at
present as also best known are the rivers which flow into
the Caribbean Sea. Chief of these is the Magdalena, 1020
miles long, the principal route to the interior. The most
important affluent of the Magdalena is the Cauca, which
enters it about 200 miles from the sea, after descending
nearly 15,000 feet in a distance of 810 miles. The Magdalena
has many other tributaries, 500 or more, a few of which,
entering from the east, are navigable for small steamers.
The Atrato River, 340 miles long, flows north between the
highlands of the West Cordillera and the Coast Range,
later turning east into the Gulf of Urabá. Of smaller streams
flowing into the Caribbean, the Sinú bears considerable
traffic. Besides these, there are the navigable Zulia, 120
miles, and the Catatumbo, 108 miles, which by way of Lake
Marcaibo in Venezuela also enter the Caribbean.</p>

<p><b>Rivers entering the Pacific.</b> Into the Pacific flow many
streams carrying much water, as the rainfall of the region
is excessive; but the courses are mostly so short and
the fall is so steep that few are navigable for any considerable
distance. The longest of them, the Patía, 270
miles, is the only one which rises on the east side of the
West Cordillera. Worth noting is the fact that this river<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
and four others, the five belonging to three different basins,
rise very near together in the highlands of southern Colombia;
the Cauca and Magdalena going north to the Caribbean,
the Putumayo and Caquetá southeast to the Amazon.
The Patía penetrates the West Cordillera by a remarkable
gorge with perpendicular walls several hundred feet in
height. On the swampy lowlands the river channels are
navigable. The San Juan River, 180 miles long, is navigable
for 140 miles, as it, like the Atrato, flows a long distance
parallel with the coast between the Baudó Range
and the Cordillera, until it turns west into the Pacific.</p>

<p><b>Amazon Tributaries.</b> The Amazon receives two large
tributaries from the southern part of Colombia: the Putumayo,
840 miles; and farther east the Caquetá, 1320 miles,
the last also called the Yapurá, especially in Brazil. These
rivers are navigable by canoe and by steamers of shallow
draft for hundreds of miles, though with interruptions in
places from difficult rapids. The Putumayo is the better,
having been ascended a distance of 800 miles from the
Amazon in a steamer drawing six feet. (The entire length
of the Hudson is 350 miles.) Smaller rivers, the Guainía
and the Vaupés, unite with the Casiquiare from Venezuela
to form the Rio Negro, another important affluent of the
Amazon. These rivers have many smaller tributaries, but
the section has been little explored save for going up or
down the main stream.</p>

<p><b>The Orinoco River</b>, which part of the way forms the
boundary between Colombia and Venezuela, receives several
important tributaries from the former country: the
Guaviare, 810 miles long, the Vichada, 312 miles, the Meta,
660 miles, and the Arauca, 480 miles. Though all are more
or less navigable the Meta is the most important. Joining
the Orinoco below the Maipures cataract and the Atures
rapids, which higher up obstruct the greater river, it permits
continuous navigation to the Atlantic Ocean. Where
joined by the Meta the Orinoco is a mile wide. The Meta<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
is navigable for 150 miles above the junction, in the rainy
season 500 miles, to a point but 100 miles from Bogotá.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Climate</span></h4>

<p>It has already been noted that the altitude of a district
as well as its latitude affects the climate, which may be
modified further by the direction of prevailing winds and
by ocean currents. The extensive and lofty mountain
ranges of Colombia therefore give the country a greater
variety of climate than it would otherwise enjoy, with temperatures
agreeable to every taste and suited to products
of almost every character. The configuration of the mountain
ranges and valleys causes a further difference in temperature
and in rainfall among points at the same altitude;
the elevations being responsible not only for their own lower
temperatures, but for the greater heat of secluded valleys,
and for other variations.</p>

<p>In the forest region of the Amazon there is much precipitation.
The open plains of the Orinoco section have less
rain, with a dry season when the rivers, which overflow in
the wet season, return to their channels and the vegetation
withers. Farther north, the Sierra de Perija of the East
Cordillera condenses the moisture of the northeast trade
winds, causing heavy rainfall on the eastern slope, but
having a dry section on the west. The Caribbean coast
near Panamá has plenty of rain, which diminishes towards
the north, Goajira being quite arid. Excessive precipitation
occurs on the West Cordillera, on the Baudó Range, and
on the southern part of the Pacific Coast, where the plains
are heavily forested and unhealthful like the valleys of the
San Juan and Atrato farther north. The lower valleys of
the Magdalena and Cauca, shut off from the prevailing
winds, are decidedly hot. These and other lowland plains
have the tropical climate, in general great humidity, and
many dense forests, except for the open drier llanos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>Above this region are enjoyable climates, the sub-tropical
ranging from 1500 to 7500 feet; still higher to 10,000 feet the
seasons are agreeably temperate in character. Beyond this
altitude it becomes quite cold, with bleak plains and passes,
here called <i>paramos</i>, mostly from 12,000 to 15,000 feet above
the sea. Higher yet are regions of perpetual snow.</p>

<p>The Santa Marta Plateau, the upper section of the Cauca
Valley, the greater part of the country traversed by the
East Cordillera, and the northern end of the Central enjoy
the subtropical or the temperate climate. Here is a large
proportion of the white population, and here the chief industries
are located. In the tropical forests and in the lower
plains and valleys the annual mean temperature is from 82°
to over 90°; at Medellín with an altitude of 5000 feet it is
70°, and at Bogotá, altitude 8600 feet, it is 57°.</p>

<p>In the north there are two seasons a year, a wet and a
dry, though not everywhere well defined; nearer the equator
there are four, two wet and two drier, as the sun passes
overhead twice a year. On the damp <i>paramos</i> the moist wintry
seasons are long and cold, so these parts are unfrequented save
by shepherds in the warmer periods. It is estimated that a
section of 150,000 square miles, twice the size of England,
has an elevation of 7000 feet or more, and there are few
points on the coast from which an agreeable climate could not
be reached in a few hours by automobile or train if roads
were provided.</p>

TERRITORIES, CHIEF CITIES</span></h3>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Capital</span></h4>

<p><b>Bogotá</b>, the Capital of Colombia, is situated on a plateau
or savanna, a sort of shelf over 8000 feet above the sea, on
the west side of the East Cordillera. The shelf, overlooked
by fine snowclad volcanoes, has a low rim on the west and
a high ridge on the east. About 70 miles long and 30
wide, it is entirely covered with towns and farms. The city
is the largest in Colombia (population probably 150,000),
on account of its being the capital and having a good climate;
the mean temperature ranges from 54° to 64°. 600
miles from the north coast and 210 from the Pacific, Bogotá
is the most difficult of access of any of the South American
capitals. Nevertheless, the city has always been noted as
the home of culture and of intellectual tastes. It is well
laid out and covers a large area, as the houses are of only
one or two stories with interior patios or courts, as in most
South American cities. Many streets have asphalt pavements;
there are hundreds of carriages and automobiles,
also 23 miles of electric tramways. Like all South American
cities, it has large plazas, open squares usually with
trees and other green in the centre, and public gardens.
The Capitol is an imposing building covering two and a half
acres. Other good public buildings include the Presidential Palace,
a public library, a museum, etc. Of course there is a
cathedral and many churches, two theatres of the first rank,
several fair hotels, a large bull ring, a hippodrome, polo
grounds, etc. Here are telephones and electric lights as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
all other considerable cities. The people are industrious,
intelligent, and fond of amusement.</p>

<p>A more precise idea of the geography of Colombia and
of the commercial possibilities of the different sections will
be gained by reviewing them in order, beginning with the
north coast, going around the outside, and concluding with
the interior.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">States and Territories</span></h4>

<p><b>The Goajira Peninsula</b>, a Comisaría at the northeast, is
inhabited chiefly by Indians who are practically independent.
They gather forest products such as tagua nuts (vegetable
ivory), breed useful horses, and do some trading at the port
of Riohacha in Magdalena. A few savage tribes make
travel in some sections dangerous. The peninsula contains
much wet lowlands, as well as mountains, extensive forests,
and fine fertile country, with considerable mineral wealth
yet unexploited: gold, and probably extensive veins of coal.
Large sections covered with guinea grass are capable of
supporting great herds of cattle.</p>

<p><b>Magdalena</b>, adjoining the Peninsula, is a Department
a great part of which is low and hot. The inhabitants
include many Indians, a friendly tribe on the Sierra Nevada.
Back of these mountains are rich valleys, where white
settlers have been disturbed by savage Indians who live on
the lower slopes of the East Cordillera. Among the products
of the region are coffee, cocoa, sugar, and bananas. The
upper valleys are the better settled and cultivated; mineral
wealth including petroleum is evident.</p>

<p>Santa Marta, the capital, an ancient city and port,
founded 1525, has recently entered upon an era of prosperity,
largely due to the enterprise of the United Fruit
Company. Finely located on a good harbor west of the
Nevada of Santa Marta, some distance east of the mouth
of the Magdalena, the city is an important centre of the
banana industry, to which it owes its present development;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
other agricultural products are for local consumption. The
climate is hot but healthful, though the banana zone is
malarial. An excellent hospital is maintained by the United
Fruit Company. Within a few miles are regions with a
delightful temperature. A Marconi wireless, one of the
most powerful in South America, is of general service,
though the property of the Fruit Company. Their enormous
banana trade is served by a 100 mile network of railways
into sections favorable to this fruit.</p>

<p><b>Atlántico</b> is a small Department occupying the flat hot
delta of the Magdalena River.</p>

<p>Barranquilla, the capital, is a busy place with many
resident foreigners. It has quays, a large new warehouse,
hotels, one of which is said to have all conveniences,
theatres, two clubs, electric lights, trams, and telephones.
In spite of the heat, which averages 82° for the year, the
deaths are less than 25 per 1000, a percentage better than in
some other tropical cities.</p>

<p><b>Bolívar</b> follows, a very large Department, with the Magdalena
River for its eastern boundary. Bolívar like Atlántico
has vast plains suited to tropical agriculture and to
cattle raising, now a growing industry. The great natural
resources of forest, agriculture, and mineral products are
but moderately developed. The breeding of horses, donkeys,
and mules is a profitable business followed by many. Ten
gold mines are worked.</p>

<p>Cartagena, the capital, is considered the most interesting
city on the Caribbean coast and one of the most picturesque
in South America. Its massive walls and fortifications
were erected at great expense nearly four centuries
ago—1535. It has fine buildings both ancient and modern,
and comfortable hotels. Montería and Lorica are busy
commercial cities on the Sinú River, each with a population
of 20,000 or more.</p>

<p><b>Antioquia</b>, the next and largest department, has a smaller
coast line. The coast section has Bolívar on the east and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
Gulf of Urabá on the west; but the larger part is south of
Bolívar, bordering at the east on the Magdalena River, with
the Departments of Santander and Boyacá opposite. At the
west is the Atrato River and through the centre the Cauca
River. All these rivers are more or less navigable by steamboats
as are some of their affluents; others at least by rafts
and canoes. Traversed also by the West and Central Cordillera
Antioquia has great diversity of character. It is the
leading Department in mining, in education, and as centre of
industries; it is among the foremost in agriculture, has the
largest, most enterprising, and prosperous population. Nearly
one-fourth of the coffee exported from Colombia comes from
Antioquia, that from Medellín bringing the highest price. The
forests contain hard wood and rubber. The Department has
five cities besides the capital with a population of 20,000 or
above, and 30 more with a population over 10,000.</p>

<p>Medellín, the capital, the second largest city of the Republic,
is said to be the wealthiest for its size of any city in South
America. It has wide streets, well built houses, many factories,
and many educational institutions. The climate is excellent,
the altitude being 4600 feet. Here is the National Mint.</p>

<p><b>Caldas</b>, south of Antioquia and formerly a part of it, is a
small Department, very mountainous, with Cundinamarca east
and Chocó west. The population, mostly white, possessing
sturdy qualities, is devoted to mining, stock raising, and to
agriculture of various zones. The rivers have rich alluvium
inciting to 2600 mining claims. In the valleys the mean temperature
ranges from 77° to 86°. Palm straw and fibres are
employed in making hats, cordage, and sacking.</p>

<p>Manizales, the capital, is an important, comparatively new
city, founded in 1846. Although distant from any river or
railway at an altitude above 7000 feet, it is growing rapidly as
a distributing centre. Sulphur and salt mines are near and
thermal and saline springs; large herds of cattle graze on the
plains.</p>

<p><b>Chocó</b>, the next coast region to Antioquia, is in striking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
contrast to Caldas. An Intendencia bordering on Panamá and
the Pacific as well as on the Caribbean, it is rich in possibilities
for mining, and for agricultural and forest products; but the
excessive rainfall and great heat, unpleasant throughout the
district, make the lowlands swampy and unhealthful, and the
whole region unattractive to settlement. Less than one-tenth
of the population is white; negroes form the great majority
of the rest, and there are some Indians. Of the latter, there
are three principal tribes in the Atrato Basin and four near
the rest of the Caribbean Coast. The Atrato Basin with that
of the San Juan forms one of the richest mining sections in
Colombia, important for the rare platinum, most of the tributaries
carrying this metal with gold. The San Juan Basin is
probably the richer in platinum. Rubber, cacao, hides, and
timber are other exports. The region will be developed some
time.</p>

<p>Quibdó, the capital, is a busy trading centre, which within
the last ten years has increased in population fourfold in spite
of the disagreeable climate.</p>

<p><b>El Valle</b>, the Department on the south, again is a striking
contrast. Although including a strip of coast with the chief
Pacific port, Buenaventura, the name of the Department indicates
the part deemed of the greatest importance; and the
one that is The Valley among so many we must expect to
have especial merits. With an altitude of 3000 feet and upwards,
it is a beautiful garden spot between the West and
Central Cordilleras, where plantains grow two feet long, a
bunch of bananas weighs 200 pounds, the cacao without cultivation
commands a higher price than that of Ecuador, where
its culture is a specialty; and sugar plantations are said to yield
for several generations without replanting or fertilizing. At
greater altitudes grow the products of temperate climes. Such
a region must some day receive intensive culture, although
now the leading industry is cattle raising; since the upper
classes are indolent, it is said, the negro laborers also. Yet a
brilliant future is sure to come. The mining outlook is good.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
Many claims for gold mines have been filed, some for platinum
and for silver, one each for emery, talc, copper, iron. There
is a large deposit of coal and of rich crystal. The rivers
possess auriferous alluvium.</p>

<p>Cali, the capital, is an old, but progressive and important
commercial city, with a fine climate, altitude 4000 feet, mean
temperature 77°. It has fine old buildings and new ones, poor
hotels, banks, automobiles, etc. Other busy cities farther
north, are Palmira, 27,000 population, and Cartago, 21,000.</p>

<p><b>Cauca</b> follows, five times the size of El Valle but with no
larger population, of which 25 per cent is white. It extends
back from the ocean south of El Valle and of the Department
Huila as well. The region has many undeveloped coal mines,
and other minerals, with vegetation tropical and temperate
in abundance. In some parts there are dense forests. Over
4000 mining claims have been filed, and gold and platinum are
exported, but agriculture is the chief industry.</p>

<p>Popayán, the capital, was founded in 1536 at an altitude
of nearly 6000 feet. At the foot of an extinct volcano and
17 miles from an active one, with a good climate it has violent
electric storms and earthquakes. It has some fine old buildings,
a university, and some say that here the best Spanish in
the New World is spoken.</p>

<p><b>Nariño</b>, the last Department at the south, has a large settled
Indian population, with some Indians uncivilized. It contains
a number of volcanoes a few of which are active; several rivers
flow into the Pacific, the Patía the most important. Gold
mines have been worked from colonial times and gold is one
of the chief exports. Other mines exist and 2500 claims have
been denounced. Rich copper has been noted; corundum
and sapphires have been found. Besides gold the chief exports
are Panamá hats, hides, rubber, coffee, tobacco, and
anise.</p>

<p>Pasto, the capital, at an elevation of 8650 feet, at the base
of the volcano Galera, has a beautiful location, a fine climate,
and a hardy industrious people. There are 21 Indian settlements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
near. Barbacoas, 100 miles from the coast, is a considerable
city of over 12,000 population where the making of
Panamá hats is a leading industry. Tumaco, population
15,000, is a picturesque island port with a better climate than
Buenaventura.</p>

<p><b>Putumayo</b>, a Comisaría east and extending far to the
southeast of Nariño, is on the northeast boundary of Ecuador,
from which it is separated by the watershed between the river
Napo and the Putumayo, which latter separates it from
Caquetá, both rivers affluents of the Amazon. The northern
part with an elevation of 3000 feet or more has a comfortable
climate.</p>

<p>Mocoa, the capital, is in this section, and a few small
towns, several entirely Indian.</p>

<p><b>Caquetá</b>, the adjoining Comisaría, is similar in character,
the higher portion a good cattle country. The animals with
other products could easily be shipped down stream to Manaos,
where they would command high prices. The lower section
is a good rubber district; cinnamon, cacao, tagua, hides, oils,
balsams, sarsaparilla, varnishes, and feathers are other products
of the region.</p>

<p><b>Vaupés</b>, the next Comisaría shares the characteristics of
the low, untrodden, rainy, forest region and of the more open
and agreeable lands higher up, a promising territory for the
rather distant future. In the Vaupés section the rivers are of
black water, near which are no mosquitoes, therefore a more
healthful region. Along the rivers of white water, which are
in the majority, mosquitoes are a terrible pest. The distinction
generally prevails in the countries of the north coast.</p>

<p>North of the Amazon region is that of the llanos belonging
to the Orinoco Basin. There is hardly a real watershed
between the two; in a number of places channels, especially
in the rainy season, connect different tributaries, besides the
well known Casiquiare connection between the Orinoco and,
by way of the Rio Negro, the Amazon.</p>

<p>The <b>Meta</b> Intendencia, formerly separated from Vaupés<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
by the Guaviare, the most southern tributary of the Orinoco
in Colombia, extends to the Meta River on the north. This
section with some country farther north is similar to the llanos
of Venezuela, chiefly grass lands of inferior quality, with
patches of forest. It supports some cattle and might a great
many more, although much of the pasture land is very wet
in the long rainy season, and so dry in the short dry season
that in many districts the grass practically disappears. The
Meta River in its lower part has Venezuela on the north;
higher at the northwest is the Casanare region (similar) of
the Department of Boyacá. Near the Meta River are more
towns, a few cattle centres, richer soil, with easier outlet to
Venezuela, to which the few exports chiefly go. The forests
of the section teem with deer and other animals, the rivers
are full of alligators; the only entrance to Casanare safe from
tribes of wild Indians is the Cravo highway from Sogamoso,
an ancient town in Boyacá, where Chibcha priests once dwelt
in palaces roofed with gold.</p>

<p>The <b>Vichada</b> Comisaría, so recently organized as not to
appear on any map (1921), is along the Vichada River between
Vaupés and Meta.</p>

<p><b>Arauca</b>, a small Comisaría, is a part of the region north
of the Meta River between Boyacá and Venezuela.</p>

<p>Arauca, the capital, on the river Arauca is called but three
days by water (generally seven) from Ciudad Bolívar, the
eastern port of Venezuela on the Orinoco.</p>

<p><b>Boyacá</b>, west and north, except for the Casanare Province,
is a Department chiefly in the <i>tierra fria</i> of the East Cordillera.
The population is mostly Indian and mestizo, the agriculture
is mainly of temperate character: wheat, barley, maize, alfalfa,
potatoes. Mining is actively carried on: gold, silver,
copper, iron, quicksilver, marble, have been denounced, and
157 emerald claims. Asphalt is worked; there are salt works
at Chita, an old Indian town, population 11,000.</p>

<p>Tunja, the capital, is called a fine old city with three public
libraries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p><b>Santander del Norte</b>, north of Santander, is also traversed
by the East Cordillera. The mean temperatures vary greatly:
46° on several <i>paramos</i>, and 81° in the valleys of the Catatumbo
and Zulia. Gold, silver, copper, lead, coal are mined.
Rio de Oro, tributary to the Catatumbo, has rich auriferous
deposits, and what is now of greater importance, it passes
through a district rich in petroleum. The varied crops are the
chief source of wealth: wheat and potatoes, coffee and cacao.</p>

<p>Cúcuta, the capital, altitude 1000 feet, with a temperature
of 84°, is an important commercial city.</p>

<p><b>Santander</b>, written also with Sur, south of Santander del
Norte and of Magdalena, has Boyacá on the east and south;
Antioquia and Bolívar are across the Magdalena River on the
west. Similar to Santander del Norte, it has more low plains.
Gold, silver, copper, talc, asphalt are found.</p>

<p>Bucaramanga, the capital, has a mean temperature ranging
from 64° to 84°.</p>

<p><b>Cundinamarca</b>, south of Boyacá, has Meta on the east,
Tolima and Huila south, and Tolima west. Less than one-half
of the population is white; about one-third is on the high
plateau, the rest on the slopes or in the Magdalena Valley, or
on the Orinoco watershed. The scattered population is in 110
municipalities. Agriculture is most important, the land near
Bogotá being especially well cultivated. In the city many factories
are operated and a variety of trades followed. Mines
are widely distributed: iron, gold, silver, copper, lead, coal,
jasper, etc.</p>

<p>Bogotá is the capital of the Department as well as of the
country.</p>

<p><b>Huila</b>, south of Cundinamarca and Tolima, has Meta and
Caquetá east, Cauca south, and Cauca and Tolima west.
Half of Huila is Government land, forest and mountain.
Cattle raising is well developed. Wheat, maize, rice, coffee,
sugar, tobacco, are cultivated on a large scale. There are
four quartz mines, and gold placers receive attention.</p>

<p>Neiva, the capital, is practically at the head of steam navigation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
on the Magdalena River. With an altitude of about
1500 feet it has an even temperature approximating 80°.</p>

<p><b>Tolima</b>, west of Huila and Cundinamarca, is a long Department
with the Magdalena River on the east and the
Central Cordillera west. Cacao and coffee are raised on
the warm lowlands. Twenty-six million coffee trees have
been producing; perhaps 4,000,000 more are now in bearing.
Over 2,000,000 tobacco plants grow on the foothills, other
crops higher, also cattle. Of the last there are 580,000, also
140,000 horses, 100,000 hogs, with fewer sheep and goats.
The rivers are auriferous and 60 properties are worked for
gold and silver.</p>

<p>Ibagué, the capital, is a pleasant and important city, an
active commercial town with mines and thermal springs in
the neighborhood, exporting a variety of articles, and with
a considerable cattle trade.</p>

</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Sea and River Ports</span></h4>

<p>Foreign commerce is carried on chiefly through five
ports, Buenaventura on the Pacific; on the Caribbean, Cartagena,
Puerto Colombia, Santa Marta, and Riohacha.
Besides these are Tumaco far south on the Pacific, and Villamizar
in Santander on the river Zulia, near the boundary
of Venezuela, well situated for trade with that neighboring
country.</p>

<p><b>Puerto Colombia</b>, the chief seaport of the country, is
situated a little west of the mouth of the Magdalena River.
Although with a notable pier a mile in length, the place
is small, merely a landing port for the greater city on the
Magdalena, to which leads a railway 17¹⁄₂ miles long.</p>

<p><b>Barranquilla</b> is frequently mentioned as the port instead
of Puerto Colombia, since it contains the national custom
house through which at least 60 per cent of the commerce
of the country passes. Yet it is not a real seaport, being 15
miles up the river, which is inaccessible to ocean steamers.
When a channel is dredged through the Boca de Ceniza
so that such steamers can reach Barranquilla, it will be of
great advantage to commerce. This work, previously arranged
for, but blocked by the outbreak of the European
War, may soon be accomplished.</p>

<p>It might have been better to make use of the “Dique,” a
natural river channel 60 miles long extending from Calamar
to the sea 15 miles south of Cartagena. This is now used in
the rainy season by river steamers, though swamps near Cartagena<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
present difficulties. Intended improvements in the channel
from Sincerín, where there is a large sugar plantation and
refinery, will make it navigable for boats of a few hundred
tons. Beginning at the “Dique” rich agricultural land extends
south.</p>

<p><b>Cartagena</b>, the port second in importance, has a fine
natural harbor and excellent wharfage facilities; the custom
house depots alongside are among the best in South
America. It is less than 2000 miles to New York (4500 to
Liverpool) and 266 from Colón.</p>

<p><b>Santa Marta</b>, northeast, is finely located on a good harbor.
Like the ports already mentioned, it has weekly steamers
to New York, New Orleans, and also to England.</p>

<p><b>Riohacha</b>, population 10,000, still farther east, is a poor
port of much less importance. Merely an open roadstead,
it is seldom visited by steamers but is frequented by sailing
vessels from Curaçao and other points.</p>

<p><b>Buenaventura</b>, the chief Colombian port on the Pacific,
with a population of 9000, is situated on an island in the Bay of
the same name, which can accommodate vessels of 24 foot
draft. A new pier, 679 feet long, just completed, has twin
docks and two railway approaches; on one side water is
28-44 feet deep. The place is regularly visited by steamers
and is an important port of entry for the rich Cauca Valley.</p>

<p><b>Tumaco</b>, farther south, a town of 15,000, is a port of
some importance for southern Colombia, the bay receiving
ships of 21 foot draft, which are served by lighters.</p>

<p><b>Villamizar</b> on the River Zulia through that and the
Catatumbo is connected with Lake Maracaibo and the
Caribbean.</p>

<p><b>Orocué</b>, population 2500, on the Meta, and <b>Arauca</b> on
the Arauca River, may be reached by steamer from Ciudad
Bolívar on the Orinoco and so communicate with the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Inland Transportation</span></h4>

<p>It is evident that the physical conformation of Colombia
is such as to render extremely difficult the construction of
railways or indeed roads of any kind. Lack of capital, and
internal disturbances have contributed to retard development
in this direction. The rivers therefore have been of prime
importance for inland travel and transport. While these are
supplemented by local railways and cart roads, the greater part
of transportation over this extensive territory is, aside from
the waterways, accomplished by means of pack and saddle
animals over <i>caminos</i> or bridle paths of varying degrees of
excellence.</p>

<p>The <b>Magdalena River</b> is the main artery of traffic, its
normal transportation being more than doubled because of
the important railways leading to or branching from the
River. As its mouth is navigable only for light launches,
nearly all freight and travel comes by rail either from
Puerto Colombia to Barranquilla, 17 miles, or from Cartagena
to Calamar, 65 miles. However, Barranquilla has
some traffic with Santa Marta by means of steam launches
of light draft through channels of the delta. By the Cartagena
railway freight is shipped without cartage to Calamar
within five days. At this town of 10,000, there is a
good pier, but poor hotel accommodations for the traveler,
who may be compelled to wait some time for a steamer.
The river has a width of from half a mile to a mile, and
an average depth of 30 feet, but in the dry season shoals
sometimes prevent for a month the ascent of the river by
steamer. Much time is consumed in loading wood for fuel,
as well as in other calls, and part of the way is unsafe for
navigation at night. This at least has been the case, but
recent and prospective dredging both on the Magdalena
and the Cauca promise much better conditions in the future.</p>

<p>The Magdalena, the regular route of travel for Bogotá,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
is navigable about 600 miles, to La Dorada on the west
bank, for steamers of 500 tons. The facilities for comfort
for the six to nine days’ journey (which has been prolonged
to three weeks in periods of low water) include staterooms
with electric lights; but passengers must now carry their
sheets, pillows, and mosquito netting; and some take food
to supplement the table fare, or make purchases en route.
It is reported that 100 eggs were bought for $2.00 in February,
1919. If the five gliders drawing but a few inches,
which have been ordered in France for the Magdalena,
prove a success, facilities for travel will be immensely improved.
A hydroplane service for passengers and mail,
Barranquilla to Girardot, is now in regular operation. Other
service elsewhere is proposed.</p>

<p>At La Dorada, the terminus of the sail on the lower
river, a change is made to the railway 70 miles long, which
was built to Ambalema, population 7000, to avoid the Honda
Rapids. Overlooking these is the busy town of Honda,
population 10,000, in the Department of Tolima, for 300
years an important centre of trade. A suspension bridge
crosses the river from which, by a rough bridle path, until
1908 most of the traffic went to Bogotá 67 miles distant.
Some freight still goes over this trail to Bogotá, or to
Facatativá, 45 miles, a two days’ ride, as well as a few
tourists, better to enjoy the scenery, to escape the heat of
the valley, or more likely, when compelled by the upper
river being too shallow for steamer traffic.</p>

<p>Usually the railway is left at Puerto Beltrán, altitude
755 feet, population 2000 (just below Ambalema), where a 100
ton steamer is taken for the 100 miles on the shallower stream
above to Girardot, a new town, population 13,000, on the east
bank, with ten hotels, and rapidly growing in commercial
importance.</p>

<p>From Girardot, altitude 1000 feet, to Facatativá, population
11,000, the Colombia National Railway climbs the
East Cordillera about 8000 feet in a distance of 82 miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
on the way to Bogotá. Twenty-five miles more on the
Sabana Railway, a road of a different gauge, brings one
to the capital, having made six changes from the ocean
steamer: first to the railway at the port; next to a steamer
on the lower river; third to the railway at La Dorada; at
Puerto Beltrán to a smaller steamer for Giradot; fifth to the
railway to Facatativá; thence to the one to Bogotá.</p>

<p>Aside from the traffic to the capital, the Magdalena with
its 500 tributaries is of enormous service. The boats call
at many small places (sometimes a single house) along the
river, from which mule trails (or a stream) lead to interior
towns in the various Departments. The first river port of
importance, about 70 miles from Barranquilla, is Calamar,
where travelers and freight from Cartagena are taken on
board. Magangué, population about 15,000, is the next
considerable town. Between Magangué and Banco the
Cauca enters the river.</p>

<p>Up the Cauca steamboats run 170 miles to Caceres; also
on one of its branches, the Nechi. Through most of its
length the Cauca is nearly parallel to the Magdalena, but
confined in a narrow valley its course is far less smooth.
Above Valdivia navigation is prevented by a stretch of 250
miles of narrow cañon and rapids; in the upper valley is
another navigable section of 200 miles, from Cali to a little
below Cartago. Being disconnected from the Caribbean
this section must seek an outlet on the Pacific.</p>

<p>The San Jorge River, nearly parallel with the lower
Cauca and entering the Magdalena a little farther down, is
navigable for 112 miles.</p>

<p>At Banco, a town of 7700 on the Magdalena, a smaller
boat may be taken up the Cesar River coming from the
northeast; at Bodega Central, population 4000, one up the
Lebrija towards Bucaramanga, to which there is another
route by way of Puerto Wilches beyond. From the latter
a railway, long ago planned and in operation for 12 miles,
is now in construction, imperatively necessary for the development<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
of this part of the country. The distance is 90
miles. From La Ceiba, 70 miles up the Lebrija, a mule
trail leads to Ocaña, population 20,000, as well as one to
Bucaramanga, which is also reached by a shorter route
from a point 22 miles up the shallower Sogamoso when that
is practicable.</p>

<p>The first railway above Calamar, found at Puerto Berrío,
population 1000, nearly 500 miles south of Barranquilla,
leads to the important city of Medellín. This, the oldest
road in Colombia, has a break where a 15 mile ride is necessary
across the mountains. When the tunnel contracted
for is completed the entire length of the road will be 120
miles. Its prospects are excellent. A second railroad has
Medellín, the Amagá, running 23 miles south towards the
rich Cauca valley, which it will soon reach. These two
roads are said to carry more freight than any others in the
country.</p>

<p>From Mariquita, population 6000, on the Dorada Railway,
an aerial Ropeway Line goes up to Manizales, in
Caldas, an excellent service for freight. From Manizales
a railway is building towards the Cauca River; 15 miles
open, 1921.</p>

<p>From the Magdalena River opposite Girardot, where a
bridge is being constructed, the Tolima Railway extends a
distance of 99 miles to Ibagué.</p>

<p>Above Girardot the steamers in high water run up to
Neiva, at times a little beyond. Here and higher, small
boats and rafts are in general use.</p>

<p><b>Cartagena</b>, in addition to its connection with the Magdalena
River, has commercial relations with the surrounding
districts, including the Chocó region, which might be served
directly by ocean steamers were it not for the fact that the
Atrato River is barred to them by sand at its mouth, though
navigable within, 280 miles to Quibdó. As only boats of
three or four feet draft can pass, and as there is no good
port on the Gulf of Urabá, commerce is carried on through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
Cartagena by transshipment, as to cities on the Sinú River
also.</p>

<p>From <b>Buenaventura</b>, the chief Pacific port, a railway
leads over the West Cordillera, 100 miles, to the important
city of Cali. From here the road branches south 21 miles
towards Popayán, and east 16 miles to Palmira, population
27,000, then north towards Buga, population 13,555, and Cartago,
population 21,500. From Buenaventura, steamboats run
up the San Juan River 140 miles, which with its tributaries has
300 miles of navigable channels, for boats of 7 or 8 foot
draft only, on account of sandbars at its delta.</p>

<p>From <b>Tumaco</b> several steamers ply on the Patía and
other rivers to Barbacoas and other towns for many miles.</p>

<p>Transportation by the tributaries of the Amazon has
already been referred to, and that by the Meta and Orinoco.
To Puerto Villamizar on the Zulia, there is a railway from
Cúcuta, 45 miles long. From this road much traffic of the
Department, Santander del Norte, is transferred to steamers
running down the river to Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Other Existing Railways and Plans</span></h4>

<p>In connection with the plantation railways, one 60 miles
long runs from Santa Marta to Fundición, from which point
a continuation has been talked of to Banco on the Magdalena,
at the mouth of the Cesar tributary. At present it is
thought better to extend the line 30 miles toward Ariguani,
a district with water for banana irrigation, timber, and good
cattle land; and later to Valle de Upar to tap the rich copper
and coal deposits found there.</p>

<p>A plan has been presented by Americans for a railway
from Bahia Honda, an excellent harbor near the end of the
Goajira Peninsula, to pass through good timber and cattle lands
and Valle de Upar, ultimately to reach Bogotá. A branch
would go from Tunja to a port opposite Berrío, and cross
roads, from Cúcuta to Tamalameque and from Puerto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
Wílches to Bucaramanga. The work requiring six years
would be financed by Americans.</p>

<p>The <b>Sabana Railways</b> are of great importance. Besides
the railway to Facatativá, two others lead from Bogotá,
one south about 20 miles to Sibate, one north about 40 miles
to Zipaquirá and Nemocón, population 5000. From Zipaquirá,
population 10,000, a road is being continued to Chiquinquirá,
population 22,500, in Boyacá, whence it is planned
to carry it down the Carare Valley to the Magdalena.
Reaching the river below La Dorada, handlings of freight
will be saved, and the time of the trip from Barranquilla
greatly shortened.</p>

<p>The <b>Tolima Railway</b> it is expected to prolong to the
Cauca Valley over the Quindio Pass to Palmira on the
Pacific Railway by way of Zarzal at the foot of the Pass.
Bogotá will then be connected by an all rail route with the
Pacific at Buenaventura, a distance of 210 miles.</p>

<p>A contract has been made for a railway, to be completed
in 1923, from Ambalema (Beltrán) to a point on the Tolima
Railway, to give Tolima direct connection with the Lower
Magdalena. A railway from Beltrán to Flandes opposite
Girardot is said also to have been arranged for.</p>

<p>A much desired rail connection is from Cúcuta to the
Magdalena. Although a road to the river port, Tamalameque,
265 miles above Barranquilla, would pass through
a dense tropical forest with few inhabitants save wild
Indians, to avoid paying tribute to Venezuela by bringing
the freight of Santander del Norte out by Barranquilla
might prove well worth while; and a new rich forest country
might thus be opened. A cart or motor road is already
under construction.</p>

<p>The <b>Pacific Railway</b>. Besides the cross country connection
from the Cauca Valley to the Magdalena, it is expected
to prolong the existing road from Buenaventura to Cali,
farther down the Cauca Valley to the Medellín, Amagá,
Cauca Railway (Amagá, a city of 10,000), the latter soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
to be completed to the Cauca River; this link with the Magdalena
Valley may be formed first. The Cauca Valley Road
now running south towards Popayán will later be prolonged
to Pasto and thence to the Ecuadorian frontier, there to join
the Pan American all rail route, which may be concluded
through Ecuador and Peru before the northern connection
is made through Panamá to Colombia.</p>

<p>Among other railways planned is one from Medellín to
Cartagena by way of Monteria.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Road Transportation and Building</span></h4>

<p>Road building in Colombia is only less difficult than
railways; hence few good roads exist. The Central Northern
extends 200 miles or more towards Bucaramanga; as
far as Sogamoso, population 16,500, 140 miles, it is used
by automobiles, the best stretch of road in the Republic.
A Northeastern Road extends for some distance. The Carretera
de Cambao leads from that Port on the Magdalena
130 miles to Bogotá, thereby avoiding the changes by way
of La Dorada. A road from Bogotá to Pasto, the Southern,
is partly in use or in construction. From Pasto it is being continued
to Tumaco and may be to Ibarra in Ecuador. A road
with parts in service leads from Pasto by way of Mocoa towards
Puerto Asis on the Putumayo, important for national
defense as well as for the development of the region. A
road from Pamplona, an old town, population 14,000, in
Santander del Norte, is partly made towards the Casanare
region. In Antioquia several roads diverge from Medellín.
The Cauca Valley has a few, on one of which from Palmira
to Buga auto service is established. Other roads are in
various sections, as the important highway building from
Cúcuta to the Magdalena. Many bridges have recently been
constructed.</p>

<p>Aside from the river traffic by steamers and small boats,
the greater part of travel and transport over this extensive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
territory is by means of horses and mules on <i>caminos</i> or bridle
paths of varying degrees of excellence, many of them extremely
poor, at times almost or quite impassable; a few paths are for
foot passengers only. The best known <i>camino</i> is from Ibagué
over the Quindio Pass to Cartago in the Cauca Valley. Another
ancient way of great importance is from Neiva across the <i>paramos</i>
of the Central Cordillera to Popayán. A network of these
<i>caminos</i> overspreads the well settled part of the country, the
meshes greatly varying in size.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br><span class="small">COLOMBIA: RESOURCES AND INDUSTRIES</span></h3>
</div>


<p>While the varied sources of Colombia’s wealth have already
been touched upon, some paragraphs follow concerning the
different lines of production and export.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Agriculture</span></h4>

<p>The country has such variation in altitude as well as such
fertility of soil that not only does almost every sort of vegetation
thrive within its borders, but it exists in most of the
Departments. An enumeration of all the localities where
the different articles are found would be needless repetition.
Reference will be made, however, to Departments where
certain products are chiefly grown. With proper cultivation
and ample labor food stuffs might be produced to satisfy
every requirement, but many are imported from other countries
more easily than they could be carried from one section
of Colombia to another.</p>

<p><b>Coffee</b>, from the commercial and export point of view,
is the most important agricultural product, in quantity coming
next to Brazil, while in quality the coffee by some is
considered second only to Arabian. Preëminent for its culture
are the Departments traversed by the Central and East
Cordilleras, especially Cundinamarca, Antioquia, Caldas,
Santander del Norte; also Cauca, El Valle, Tolima, and the
north slope of the Nevada de Santa Marta. In Colombia
coffee grows best at altitudes of 2000-6000 feet, the higher
the milder the coffee. At 5000 feet no shade is required,
though necessary when first planted in most places where
it is raised. Everywhere coffee seems to prefer sloping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
ground. In Cauca, where 720 trees are planted to the acre,
they produce for 50 or 60 years. Coffee from Santander,
mostly going out by way of Maracaibo, is sold under that
name. We hardly think of coffee as a product of the temperate
zone, but in Colombia it is so classed, growing in the
same altitudes as temperate fruits, vegetables, and cereals.</p>

<p><b>Bananas</b> are the most important crop of the lowlands,
especially since the exploitation of the Santa Marta district
by the United Fruit Company. Ninety per cent of the
bananas raised in this section are exported by the company
under contract with private growers. Banana land of the
company is well laid out with irrigating canals, managers’
and laborers’ houses, etc. Export has increased enormously.
As the section is watered by five rivers and many brooks,
it is especially favorable for the irrigation needed. The
trunks and leaves of the plant, which might be utilized for
cordage, paper, card-board and textiles, at present go to
waste. The cost of clearing and preparing land for the industry,
with 350 trees to the acre, is about $45. Within two
years the annual receipts are $40, largely profits. The Company
owns 28,000 acres of improved land (10,000 devoted
to cattle) and twice as much land unimproved. The bananas
are free of export duty and taxation. The fruit may
be grown in all the lowland sections where irrigation is
practicable, which is almost everywhere. Before the War
the Germans near the Gulf of Urabá started a plantation
of 12,000 acres, one third of which is under cultivation.</p>

<p><b>Plantains</b> are widely raised for native use, as they form
the chief article of food for the masses in the lower districts.
Higher up maize is the staple. The plantain requires little
cultivation, the crops are heavy, and the plantations last
for years. The fruit is eaten either green or ripe.</p>

<p><b>Sugar cane</b>, grown extensively on the fertile lands of the
valleys, without fertilizer and with occasional hoeing, gives
crops of 80 tons per acre, averaging 40 tons. It flourishes
up to 7000 feet. Small primitive mills are the rule, but a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
few with modern machinery have been established, one near
Cartagena. A brown sugar is chiefly made in the small
mills, <i>pantana</i>, which is palatable and nourishing; but some
is refined for table use and for the chocolate factories. A
large amount of sugar is used for <i>chicha</i> (sugar syrup fermented
with corn), for denatured alcohol, and for <i>aguardiente</i>,
a kind of rum; the last is a government monopoly. The sugar
production is hardly sufficient for local needs.</p>

<p><b>Tobacco</b>, which some think equal to the best Havana,
is raised, mostly for local consumption; formerly much was
exported to Bremen.</p>

<p><b>Cacao</b> grows wild on thousands of acres, some trees
reaching a height of 45 feet; but to give the best results
it must be cultivated. It is planted for early protection
under bananas, together with other trees which will give shade
later. Local demand consumes most of the supply. Little
attention is paid to its cultivation, though the Magdalena
and Cauca Valleys are well adapted to it. Trees 60 years
old are found in bearing.</p>

<p><b>Coconut</b> palms might be more largely cultivated, plantations
existing chiefly on the coast and islands. The fibres
and oil are useful and many nuts are exported.</p>

<p><b>Rice</b> grows freely in rich, hot, irrigated land, but it is
not largely cultivated.</p>

<p><b>Cotton</b> of excellent quality is raised from Egyptian seed
on the Caribbean coast and in Antioquia; it is found growing
wild at low and moderate altitudes all over the country.
But little use is made of it except where factories are near,
these promoting its culture. The plants, perennials, grow
12 feet high. The cotton, unrivalled for length of fibre, is
all used locally.</p>

<p><b>Other fibrous plants</b> are the <i>Agave Americana</i> or century
plant, which is cultivated as a hedge; enough is produced
to satisfy most of the home demand for fibre for ordinary
rope and twine, also for making common packing sacks,
and alpargatas, sandals worn by the poorer people. Here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
grow ramie and other shrubs, the fibre of which is used
for vegetable silk. Ramie on the Bogotá River yields 6
crops a year without irrigation, the stems 6 feet long having
a very tough fibre. Most of the Magdalena land could not
be better used than for raising such plants. A recent invention
to extract the fibre by a chemical process makes
its culture important. Jute in Colombia on the same soil
as ramie reaches double the height attained in its native
country, and gives two cuttings a year, the first crop three
months after planting.</p>

<p><b>Wheat</b> gives good crops on the highlands, and <b>maize</b>
(corn) grows everywhere, in the rich lower valleys producing
three crops a year. Potatoes and other vegetables
grow in various altitudes.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Forestry</span></h4>

<p>The natural wealth of the forests is enormous, though
at present largely inaccessible for lack of transportation
facilities, a condition which might easily be remedied so
far as the forests of the Pacific Coast and of the Atrato
and Magdalena Basins are concerned. The chief products
now are rubber and tagua nuts.</p>

<p>The <b>Rubber</b> is of both the <i>caucho</i> and the <i>hevea</i> varieties,
the former of inferior quality, procured by cutting down the
trees, the <i>hevea</i> or fine Pará by tapping. The former is obtained
by the Tolimenses from the Rio Negro section, the latter
by Indians of Vaupés, this being sent down to Manaos.
Rubber also comes from Chocó, being collected by Indians
and negroes who exchange it for goods at Quibdó, at places
on the San Juan River, also at Barbacoas, back of Tumaco.
A few plantations have been started in the Atrato and Magdalena
Valleys and near Tumaco. Balatá and chicle are also
exported.</p>

<p><b>Tagua Nuts</b>, which have only to be picked up, are gathered
in the forests on the Pacific slope and in the Atrato<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
and the Magdalena Basins, the best quality from the Sogamoso
tributary of the latter. This is called vegetable ivory,
from which buttons, etc., are made.</p>

<p><b>Timber</b> of great value exists, a little of which is exported:
Colombia mahogany, cabinet and dye woods; but
there are few saw mills, and the great variety of trees in a
small area renders their exploitation difficult.</p>

<p><b>Medicinal plants</b> are numerous: cinchona, sarsaparilla,
ipecac, balsams, etc. Many other valuable plants abound
but are little exploited.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Live Stock</span></h4>

<p>The <b>Cattle</b> raising industry is one of the most favorable
for immediate profit. The best quality of grass is found on
the plains of Magdalena, Bolívar, and Atlántico, where there
are large areas of planted pasture. An acre and a half
supports a steer. Pará grass, native to Brazil, is used on
wet or swampy ground and guinea grass on drier. On the
eastern llanos are millions of wild cattle, with some ranches;
but the grass is generally so poor that the cattle are sometimes
brought to the Magdalena Valley to be fattened,
though this is difficult. There are 4,000,000 head in the
country with 80,000 annually available for export. Modern
packing houses are now being established with important
Government aid. Material and supplies for construction
are exempt from import duties; and outgo for 20 years
from export taxes. With attention to breeding and to good
fodder for fattening the production may rival that of Argentina.</p>

<p>In the Sinú Valley region are said to be 1,000,000-1,500,000
cattle. An American and Colombian Company
holding 75,000-100,000 acres along the River, with a herd of
40,000 cattle, is now (1921) erecting a packing house costing
$1,750,000 on Morrisquillo Bay, 60 miles from Cartagena.
They expect soon to begin operations, slaughtering 500 head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
a day. On account of proximity to the United States, the
prices of Colombian cattle could probably not be equalled
here by the countries farther south. A packing house at Cali
may be desirable.</p>

<p><b>Other Stock.</b> Horses. As an absolute necessity on account
of the scarcity of wagon roads, many saddle horses
are raised, Andalusian crossed with Arabian or English.
Some saddle horses are imported from Peru. Mules and
donkeys are found in large numbers. Goats are numerous
in all quarters, and sheep are raised on the highlands. There
is a large exportation of hides and skins.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Mining</span></h4>

<p>This is an industry of great promise, the as yet bare
scratching of the surface showing infinite possibilities for
the future. Practically every mineral of commercial value
has been found, including the rarer metals. The lack of
proper transportation makes some sections impracticable
and others difficult, but important work has been carried on
in many places; opportunities lie open in many more. Gold is
found in almost all sections, both in quartz veins and in
placers. There is native silver, and some with gold and
tin. Platinum ores running from 80 to 85 per cent are
found with gold and other metals. Iron is widely distributed;
also copper; often with gold, tin, and in primitive
rock formation. Manganese, lead, mercury, sulphur, zinc,
antimony, arsenic, nitre, alum, exist, but are not much
worked except sulphur, which is taken from some volcanoes.
The working of the salt mines is a government monopoly,
rock salt and springs existing in large numbers. From the
Zipaquirá salt mine in Cundinamarca the Government receives
a revenue of approximately $1,000,000 a year.</p>

<p><b>Coal</b> was first discovered in 1865 near Santa Marta Bay,
and subsequently other deposits. Most important just now
are the beds near Cali, which are thought to be very extensive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
and to extend through the mountains to the Pacific
slope. It is said that enough coal could be mined to supply
the neighboring Republics as well as Colombia. The probable
supply is estimated at 27 million tons. The character of
coal in the country varies from lignite to bituminous. A
wide vein of cannel coal leads from the Nevada de Santa
Marta towards the Goajira Peninsula; an anthracite deposit
25 feet thick extends 50 miles north and south near the Gulf
of Urabá. Coal deposits exist for a distance of 300 miles
north and south of Bogotá near the East Cordillera, others in
the formation of the Central and West Ranges. One bed near
Cali in places is 22 feet thick. Coal beds in three layers are
cut by the Amagá Railway, and the locomotives are fired on
the track.</p>

<p><b>Petroleum</b> exists in quantity indefinite, but hardly to be
overestimated. The great tract of country extending several
hundred miles back from the entire south shore of the
Caribbean apparently contains a collection of oil reservoirs
which may exceed in magnitude those of any other section
of the Western Hemisphere. Nowhere else in the world,
it is said, is there so great a display of seepages and of
petroliferous mud volcanoes.</p>

<p>Colombia presents three more or less distinct regions
with various fields in which operations have been conducted;
others in which the surface indications will doubtless incite
to careful examination in the future. The three well known
regions are the Caribbean, the Magdalena, and the Maracaibo;
the last two are also spoken of together as the Magdalena-Santander
Field, since an oil belt extends from Venezuela
south-southwest across Santander and the Magdalena
River. But as a mountain range separates the Maracaibo
Basin from the Magdalena Valley, the two are quite distinct.</p>

<p>The Caribbean Region which extends along the coast
from Riohacha to the Gulf of Urabá has 300 or more square
miles of supposedly productive territory. Many American
companies have obtained concessions; more than 100 are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
organized for the exploitation of this and other districts.
So rapidly have sections been taken up that a considerable
part of the coastal tract west of the Magdalena is already
occupied. British interests also have acquired extensive
holdings in the Republic. Emissions of gas occur in many
places, this being the first country in South America where
large amounts have been observed. Among the petroliferous
mud volcanoes is the largest known anywhere. In the
Tubara field is a well 3000 feet deep from which enormous
quantities of gas came off. It has been proposed to pipe
the gas to Barranquilla for use in the city.</p>

<p>The Magdalena pool or region extends along the river
valley for several hundred miles. The fields already occupied
are mainly on the east side. In this section the first
oil gusher of Colombia was brought in not far from Barranca
Bermeja, about 400 miles south of Barranquilla. A
second well 2270 feet deep shot oil over the derrick several
hours before it could be capped. It was rated at from 2000
to 20,000 barrels daily. Steady flow is estimated at 6000
to 8000 barrels daily. The oil, which is dark with some
asphalt, gives about 30 per cent gasoline, 6 of kerosene, 20
lubricating oil, and 12 asphalt. A pipe line and wagon road
are being constructed from the three wells drilled near the
Colorado River 35 miles to Barranca Bermeja where a refinery
has been erected. It is said that this is to supply
Colombia with gasoline, kerosene, and lubricants at prices not
above those of New York. The use of residual fuel oil on the
river steamers will greatly facilitate their operation. It is
likely that a larger refinery will be erected at Cartagena or
as rumored on an island at the mouth of the Magdalena, but
the cost of reported pipe lines 300 or 400 miles long in this
region would be prohibitive. Tank steamers will well serve
the purpose.</p>

<p>Higher up the river near Honda is the Tolima field where
live seepages occur and a well has been drilled. [Many locations
have been secured in a stretch of several hundred miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
along the valley.] This field includes the upper Magdalena
Basin, with which are classed the groups on the edge of the
San Martín and Casanare plains east of the Cordillera. In
the Orinoco Basin oil has been seen floating on the surface
of the rivers.</p>

<p>The Maracaibo Basin, which is chiefly in Venezuela, has
a section running over into Colombia where the Barco concession
is located. An area of more than a million acres is
occupied by an American company. Here oil seepages include
some wonderful springs. Oil from one of these runs
a small refinery which produces 25 barrels a day. The oil
with a loss of only 1.1 per cent is said essentially to match
the high grade Pennsylvania oil, selling for $4.00 a barrel
at the well. Wells were first drilled on the Venezuelan side
of the Rio de Oro, tributary to the Catatumbo; later on
the Colombian side.</p>

<p>There is further a Pacific district extending north and
south from Buenaventura a distance of 60 or 70 miles, from
Quibdó on the Atrato to Cali on the Cauca with a small
section on the coast. The probable productive area is 18
miles but none is proved.</p>

<p>The location of these extensive deposits, many within
200 miles of tide water, is of prime importance to the commercial
world, especially because of their proximity to the
Panamá Canal, soon to be one of the great shipping routes
of the world. Moreover the port of Cartagena, which
already has several refineries and will serve as the chief
depot of export and supplies, is nearer to New York than
is Tampico by 400 miles, than Galveston, Texas, by 50 miles.
It is also much nearer to London, to Panamá, and to our
own Pacific Coast. Clearly, the development of the petroleum
deposits of Colombia is of the greatest interest and
importance to the United States. It is believed that its oil
fields will equal or surpass those of Peru.</p>

<p><b>Platinum.</b> At the moment the greatest mining wealth
is in gold, with a good bit in platinum. Over $2,000,000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
worth of the latter was exported in 1917. Platinum, usually
with gold, is found in rivers near the Pacific: the Atrato,
Condoto, Platina, and San Juan. Operations have been carried
on in several districts. The concessions of an American
company include a tract on the San Juan and one on its
tributary Condoto and its branches, with holdings north and
east of the river deposits. By means of a small wood burning
dredge with annual capacity of but 250,000 cubic yards,
about $600,000 worth of platinum was obtained in 1918 when
the Government price was fixed at $105 an ounce. With
a second and larger dredge now operating and a third expected
soon, much greater production will be realized. In
1920 the value fluctuated from $70 to $165 an ounce. In
June, 1921, it was $75. The value of the two tracts is estimated
at $52,000,000 at the former Government price. Costs
are little greater than in the California and New Zealand
fields, and with suitable precautions taken in the way of
drainage, mosquito netting, etc., as at Panamá, and with
good medical attendance, health conditions have been made
about the same as on the Isthmus. Extraordinary platinum
values have been shown; the gravel handled in 1918 furnishing
$2.50 gold and platinum per cubic yard. The extensive
use of platinum in dental work, in jewelry, and for
important though limited service in certain manufactures,
in sheet, wire, and granulated form, indicates an annual need
of 165,000 ounces in the United States alone. A unique
opportunity is offered in Colombia for the production of
this valuable metal.</p>

<p><b>Gold.</b> The gold of the Chocó placers has been widely
known since the Spanish Conquest. Four hundred million
dollars was taken by the Castilians from shallow waters
and easily worked river banks. In recent years a number
of companies have been operating. The Pato mines cover
40,000 acres near Zaragoza, population 2700, Antioquia,
where a dredge is operated. At the Nechi mines the
dredging cost is 9 cents a yard, the return about 75 cents.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
In Antioquia there are 20 rivers with gold alluvium, but
operations are chiefly on the Cauca, Nechi, Pato, and Porce.
The bench gravel is very deep and can be worked profitably
(except at times by the natives) only with machinery, as
is the case generally. Therefore considerable capital is
necessary for a successful enterprise. More than 12,000
gold bearing sites are known in Antioquia; many in Nariño,
Caldas, El Valle, Tolima and Chocó. The gold production
in Colombia since the Conquest is estimated as above $600,000,000
and that of silver as $30,000,000.</p>

<p><b>Emeralds.</b> The most famous mining industry of the
country is emeralds; for nowhere else are they produced
in quantity and here are the best. The mines were
worked long before the coming of the Spaniards, and the actual
labor has been performed by the Indians ever since. The
mining has been a Government monopoly. The area is a
region of 4000 square miles, but the only mine recently
operated is the Muzo, 92 miles northwest of Bogotá. It is
now worked by the open system though formerly by tunnel.
The workers live on the ground in buildings provided for
the men and officers, with police to prevent thieving. Present
operations are in almost vertical cliffs rising from 100 to
550 feet above small valleys. The loose soil is not removed
by water, as is stated elsewhere; the emeralds are separated
from the soil by a dry method; water is used to carry away
the detritus and also to wash the residue left by material
from rotten veins in order to expose small emerald crystals.
The output in normal years approaches 800,000 carats.
No attempt should be made to obtain a possible concession
without thorough investigation and ample capital. The
same may well be said of any mining venture. A concession
for emerald mining has been secured by an American
company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Other Industries</span></h4>

<p><b>Manufacturing</b> is fostered by high duties on many goods;
further by concessions such as exemption from taxes, land
grants, or money, to persons establishing factories. In return
the goods must be sold lower than those imported.
Some large business firms finance other enterprises such as
coffee and factories. Of manufactures textiles are the most
important. In Barranquilla there are 200 British electric
looms run by boys and women; British yarns are imported
and worked up into domestics and drills; there are other
factories at Bogotá, Cartagena, Medellín, and two for fine
woolen cloth at Bogotá. Some cotton spinning is done; two
new spinning mills in Barranquilla each have 2500 spindles.
In cottages are many looms for the spinning of wool, in which
the Indians are very proficient.</p>

<p>In one place or another are factories of almost every
kind: silk, flour, chocolate, matches, shoes, tanneries, ice,
mineral waters, breweries, tiles, iron and steel, glass, candles,
soap, etc. Bogotá has the largest number of factories, about
40, Medellín the next; others are well scattered over the
country. Few do much more than supply local wants, partly
on account of the difficulties of transportation.</p>

<p><b>Export.</b> The only manufactured product important in
export is <i>Panamá hats</i>. The principal centers of the industry
are Antioquia, Nariño, Huila, and Santander Sur. The hats
are made of <i>toquilla</i> palm, the young leaves of which are cut
off, split into thin strips by a small wooden knife, spread out
in the sun to dry, and then woven. The hats are not made
under water, but the straw must be kept very damp to avoid
breaks and splits; so weavers sometimes go into damp
caves. Near Pasto, Nariño, hats are made almost equal in
fineness to those of Montecristi, Ecuador. The industry has
a bright future unless Japan by cheaper labor drives the
South American product from the market. To prevent this
the export of raw straw may be forbidden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Investments</span></h4>

<p>Colombia obviously offers a wide and varied field for
investments, but like the other South American Republics,
on account of low wages, it presents no opportunities favorable
to ordinary laborers unless in agriculture. An immigrant
may receive a free grant of land of 6175 acres, which
he must within ten years cultivate over one third of the
area; or if cattle lands, two thirds must be occupied.</p>

<p>Various forms of agriculture may be attractive to persons
of moderate capital: sugar cane, bananas, coffee, cacao, cotton,
fruits, etc., as also agave or other fibre material. Tagua groves
in <i>baldíos</i> may be exploited.</p>

<p>Discoverers of mines in <i>baldíos</i>, Government lands, have a
preferential right to 1250 acres of land adjoining the mines
denounced. The abundance of water power is of great value
to investors of every kind, being equally important for mining,
factories, and agriculture.</p>

<p>Factories on account of high tariffs make excellent profits.
Cattle and sheep raising offer good prospects. Public works
including drainage, water supply, sewers, road and railway construction,
bridges, and development of electric power should
afford many and varied opportunities.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br><span class="small">VENEZUELA: AREA, HISTORY, GOVERNMENT,
POPULATION, ETC.</span></h3>
</div>


<p>East of Colombia is the only other Republic on the north
coast of South America, Venezuela.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Area, Population, Boundary</span></h4>

<p><b>Area.</b> Next to Colombia in position, Venezuela is also
next in size. Sixth of the South American Republics in area,
her territory covers about 394,000 square miles, equal to
that of California, Arizona, and New Mexico.</p>

<p><b>Population.</b> With approximately 3,000,000 inhabitants,
Venezuela is entitled to the same rank in population, for
though Chile with smaller area surpasses her in this respect,
Bolivia with greater extent of territory probably has fewer
inhabitants. As neither country has accurate statistics to
consult there is some uncertainty about the matter.</p>

<p><b>Boundary.</b> Venezuela is irregular in outline, but in general
her boundary is as follows. The Caribbean Sea is on
the north, the Atlantic northeast, British Guiana east; also
a part of Brazil is east of a southern projection of Venezuela;
Brazil is on the south, with Colombia also south of a western
projection; Colombia alone is on the west.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">History</span></h4>

<p>The land of Venezuela was sighted by Columbus in 1498;
in 1499 it was explored to some extent by Alonzo de Ojeda,
who gave the country its name (Little Venice), the Indian
dwellings on piles in Lake Maracaibo reminding him of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
famous Italian city. Settlements were made early in the
16th century, the first especially for the sake of the rich
pearl fisheries. On account of the bad faith and cruelty
of the Spaniards and the warlike spirit of the natives, many
disorders and atrocities occurred, accompanied by quarrels
among the Spaniards themselves.</p>

<p>In 1810 the citizens of Caracas deposed the Governor; the
following year independence was declared, but it was not
secured until the Royalists were defeated in the battle of
Boyacá in 1819. The Great Colombian Republic was then
formed by General Bolívar, though the last royalist adherents
did not give up until 1823. Venezuela withdrew from
the Union in 1830; the hero and patriot Bolívar died the
same year. Many internal difficulties and changes of government
have characterized the period of independence,
though comparative quiet has succeeded the exit of Castro
in 1909.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Government</span></h4>

<p>In contrast with Colombia, the Republic is a federal and
not a centralized union. It has the usual three branches:
a President with his Cabinet forms the Executive Department;
there are two Houses of Congress; also a Supreme
Court.</p>

<p>The twenty States have each a President and a Legislature,
a Supreme and other Courts. The two Territories
and the Federal District are administered by Governors
appointed by the President, who is elected for seven years.</p>

<p>The names of the States and of their capitals follow,
with their populations estimated, as until recently no census
had been taken since 1897. The new figures (December,
1921) are received only for the Territories. The Coastal
States beginning at the northwest are Zulia, Falcón, Yaracuy,
Carabobo, Aragua, the Federal District, Miranda,
Anzoátegui, Sucre, Monagas. Anzoátegui and Monagas are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
also Llano States, with Guárico, Cojedes, Portuguesa, Zamora,
and Apure. Táchira, Mérida, and Trujillo are Mountain
States; Lara, north of Trujillo, almost comes into the
coast region. Nueva Esparta is an Island State. Bolívar,
south of the Orinoco, lies between the two Territories, Delta
Amacuro and Amazonas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Population</span></h4>

<p>The number of inhabitants, estimated as a trifle less than
3,000,000, is about seven to a square mile. Seventy per cent
of the people are called poor, hence with a rather small
purchasing power. The Federal District has about 15 persons
to the mile, the density in general decreasing in proportion
to the distance from the capital. The Guayana
region, the Delta, and Apure, supposed to have less than
half a person to a mile, are among the least populated regions
of the globe.</p>

<p>The white population is ranked as about 10 per cent of
the whole, the mestizos, those of mixed race, as 70 per cent;
the rest are Africans, Indians, and foreigners. About ³⁄₄ of
a million live in 48 towns; 75,000 are engaged in agriculture.
In most of the cities are people accustomed to European
society, with a taste for European luxuries, as well as those
of simpler habits and desires. As in Colombia, the requirements
of those who live high on the mountains and those
on the llanos are very different. Attractive inducements
are offered to immigrants for colonization.</p>

<p>The Indians are of many tribes, some quite distinct from
the others. As a small part of the Goajira Peninsula is in
Venezuela, there are Goajiros like those in Colombia. A
large proportion of the aborigines became mingled with
the Spaniards; in the mountainous sections of the north live
few Indians of pure blood. In the region of the Delta and
in the southern part of the country are many Indians of
at least 16 tribes; some are dirty and stupid, others intelligent
and fierce; some are good workers and boatmen, others
are timid and agricultural. The Arawaks are gentle, industrious,
and clean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Education</span></h4>

<p>Venezuela’s percentage of illiteracy has been high, but since
1912 the system of education has been reorganized. The
National Government has established in the principal cities
primary schools with six grades. Attendance at four of these
since 1919 is compulsory. The teaching of English was then
ordered. In the various capitals are 22 colegios (high schools),
several cities having also Commercial Schools, Schools of Fine
Arts, and of Arts and Trades.</p>

<p>There are Universities in Caracas and in Mérida, with
Schools of Law, Medicine, Philosophy and Letters, Engineering,
Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Theology.</p>

<p>States and Municipalities make additional provision.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Press, Religion, Etc.</span></h4>

<p><b>The Press</b> includes official gazettes in the capitals of the
States, and other periodicals devoted to scientific, literary,
and other special subjects.</p>

<p><b>Religion.</b> There is freedom in religion; the State, however,
contributes to the Roman Catholic Church. Civil
marriage alone is legal; the religious ceremony generally
follows, although in the rural districts, where priests are
scarce and the fees high, both ceremonies are often omitted.
Divorce is now permissible.</p>

<p>Venezuela belongs to the Postal Union and has parcel
post; but service to the interior is rather primitive.</p>

<p>The <b>Telegraph</b> service, with about 6000 miles of wire, is
cheap and called efficient; the telephone lines have double
their length of wire. At Caracas, Maracaibo, and Maracay
there are wireless stations communicating with Curaçao and
so with the outside world. There is also cable service.</p>

<p><b>Money</b> is in gold, silver, and nickel coins, and there are
bank notes issued by four banks. The bolívar is the unit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
money, equal to the French franc: 19.3 cents. A dollar
passes for 5 bolívars. American money circulates near the
coast, as does the English sovereign. The natives frequently
use the term peso for which they employ the $ sign. As the
peso equals but 4 bolívars this creates confusion and mistakes
must be guarded against.</p>

<p>The <b>Metric System</b> is official, compulsory, and in general
use.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br><span class="small">VENEZUELA: PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The configuration of Venezuela is simpler than that of
Colombia; the country has four distinct sections:</p>

<p>First, a mountain region including the Venezuelan
Andes, which is a branch of the East Cordillera of Colombia;
and a range called the Maritime Andes extending along the
coast.</p>

<p>Second, lying east and south of the mountains, the great
plain of the llanos occupying a large part of the Orinoco
Basin.</p>

<p>Third, the Guiana or Guayana Highlands south of the
Orinoco, extending to the eastern and southern boundaries
and occupying a great extent of unexplored territory.</p>

<p>Fourth, the coastal plain around Lake Maracaibo.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">First Section</span></h4>

<p>The Andes coming in from Colombia cross the northwestern
portion of Venezuela in two or more ranges, separating the
great Orinoco Basin from the lowlands lying between this chain
and that part of the Colombian East Cordillera called the
Sierra de Perija. A number of the mountains are above
13,000 feet, the highest, La Columna, is 16,522 feet. Though
none of the mountains are volcanoes, earthquakes are common.
The general height of the range decreases on the
south towards Colombia, and north towards the Caribbean
Sea, till at one point at the north, near where the city of
Barquisimeto is located in the valley between the two
ranges, the Rio Cojedes goes through to the Orinoco Basin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
Beyond the Cojedes River the Maritime Andes stretch along
the coast in two parallel ranges, the high valley between
them being the most densely populated part of the country.
The peak above Caracas, called the Silla de Caracas, one of
the highest of this section, has an altitude of 8650 feet;
Naiguatá passes 9000. After a considerable break at Cape
Codera the mountains continue to the Gulf of Paria.</p>

<p>The western branch of the Venezuelan Andes, turning
north, continues towards the coast in low ranges called the
Segovia Highlands, with the Maracaibo district on the west.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Second Section</span></h4>

<p>East and south of this mountainous country is the vast
region, thinly populated and not well known, of the great
Orinoco Basin, occupying three fourths of the country; first
come the llanos, followed by a forested district, with
hilly, mountainous country beyond. The llanos, covering
87,000 square miles on the north side of the great river,
are grassy plains broken by islands of trees. Near the mountains
north and west are extensive forests. The llanos are
of slightly varying altitude, in parts rising imperceptibly,
but often by terraces or banks a few feet high. In the western
section there are large tracts in the Portuguesa Valley
but 300 feet above the sea; in other places the land rises
to 650 feet, and to a still greater height on the mesas
which form the watershed between the Orinoco and the
rivers Unare and Aragua flowing into the Caribbean Sea.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Third Section</span></h4>

<p>South and east of the Orinoco River are the Guiana
Highlands, said to cover 200,000 square miles, for the most
part a plateau 1000 feet and upwards in elevation, from
which rise several mountain chains connected by lower hills,
the Parime Range separating the Orinoco and Amazon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
Basins. A few peaks rise 8000 feet; the highest known is
Mt. Roraima, 8500 feet, at the southeast corner, where the
boundaries of British Guiana, Brazil, and Venezuela come
together.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Fourth Section</span></h4>

<p>This region, much smaller, occupies the northwest part
of the Republic, which may be considered as a coastal plain.
It includes the alluvial area around Lake Maracaibo, the
Coro and the Paraguana lowlands, with open sandy hills
extending along the shore of the Gulf of Venezuela to the
end of the Paraguana Peninsula, and some islands of the
same character.</p>

<p>The Lake district is somewhat similar to the Orinoco
Delta, with many rivers coming in at the south, and with
open lagoons and swamps; it is bordered by dense forests
often inundated by rains. East and west towards the north
between the swamps are higher lands with some grassy
plains. At the west is the Sierra de Perija on the Colombian
frontier.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Rivers and Lakes</span></h4>

<p>Venezuela is said to have 72 large and more or less
navigable rivers, of which the Orinoco is the chief. Its
length, variously stated, may be 1570 miles and the area
of its basin 370,000 square miles.</p>

<p>The <b>Orinoco</b>, rising near the Brazilian boundary, first
flows northwest, then northerly forming the boundary line
with Colombia, and from the entrance of the Meta River,
northeast and east to the Atlantic Ocean. Its low forested
delta covers 8500 square miles. Boca de Navios, the largest
mouth, is 20 miles wide with a depth of 17 feet at the bar.
Among the 400 or more tributaries the most important are
the Caroni, the Caura, and the Ventuari, draining the mountainous
and forested section at the south; and the Guaviare,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
Vichada, Meta, and Apure coming in from the west, the
first three from Colombia. The Casiquiare, previously mentioned,
connects the Orinoco with the Rio Negro.</p>

<p>Among other rivers of importance are the Catatumbo and
the Escalante flowing into Lake Maracaibo and the Tocuyo
into the Caribbean.</p>

<p>Among the 205 lakes, Maracaibo, covering 8392 square
miles, is obviously the largest and most important. Other
lakes are Valencia, Zulia, Laguneta, and Camaguán, but
many of the 200 are mere shallow lagoons which serve as
breeding places for mosquitoes.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Climate</span></h4>

<p>As might be expected, the climate of the country is similar
to that of Colombia, with corresponding variations for
altitude: tropical to about 2000 feet; above that to 7000
temperate; still higher, cold, with mean annual temperatures
ranging from 60° to zero or less on the high mountains.
The hot region, <i>tierra caliente</i>, includes the coastal plains with
the Maracaibo district, the llanos, a large part of the Guayana
Highlands, and a few of the lower mountain valleys.
The islands are the coolest, the llanos the warmest part of
the tropical region; the hottest section of the latter is south
and west, the farthest from the sea. Along the coast the
temperature ranges from 64°-68° to 93°-95°. The temperate
region includes the most thickly settled sections at moderate
elevation, while the cold mountain heights have comparatively
few inhabitants. On the llanos the dry season
is from November to May, or June, the rainy following to
November. The coast has two rainy seasons, December
and January, and April to July. The Orinoco Delta and
parts of the Guiana section are the most unhealthful; the
lowest death rate, rather strangely, is in the cities of the
llanos, the next lowest in the regions of the Andes and the
Caribbean Mountains.</p>

<p><b>Caracas</b>, the capital of the Republic, founded in 1567, is
a very attractive city with a delightful climate. Only occasionally
does the temperature go below 60° or above 80°.
Eight miles in a straight line from its port, La Guaira, from
which it is 23 miles by rail, the city is at an altitude of 3036
feet on the south side of the outer Coast Cordillera. The
city is in the usual Spanish American style, with beautiful
plazas and promenades. Exceptionally, the streets, which
are at right angles, are numbered instead of named, but the
old names are in general use. Notable buildings are the
Capitol covering more than two acres, the Miraflores Palace,
the Cathedral, University, National Pantheon, Masonic
Temple, called the best in South America, a beautiful
theatre, etc. A fine view is had from the hill Calvario, 200
feet above, the slopes of which are arranged as a public
garden. Caracas is up to date in modern conveniences,
water supply, street cars, etc., and has a good and cheap
cab service. The city is near the west end of a rich valley
12 miles long and 3 wide, which slopes towards the southeast.
The Guaire River below the city flows into the Rio
Tuy.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Individual States</span></h4>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Coastal States</span> follow with the Island State, and
Lara, which is neither coast, llano, nor mountain, though
having some hills. The coast line extends over 1800 miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p><b>Zulia</b>, the large State (23,000 square miles) occupying
the northwest corner of the Republic, has Colombia on the
west and northwest, the Gulf of Venezuela northeast,
Falcón, Lara, and Trujillo east, and Mérida with a little of
Táchira south. This State, of which Maracaibo is the capital,
is one of the wealthiest in the Republic, though still
sparsely inhabited. The Maracaibo Plain, the most conspicuous
and important section occupying the greater portion
of the State, lies between the two great branches of the
East Cordillera. The lake itself is a sheet of water about
150 miles long and half as wide, the water sweet in the
southern half of the lake, but brackish towards the north.
The precipitation in this district amounts to 70 inches annually.
Thus an enormous amount of fresh water from the
Cordillera is continually entering the lake through its various
affluents; of these the Catatumbo with its tributary
Zulia, and the Escalante, are navigable for steamboats. The
lake has a depth of 30 feet and is served by several lines
of steamers as well as by sailing craft. A few small towns
on the lake receive agricultural products from their vicinity;
along the shore cacao is cultivated with great profit. There
is a fine goat farming district; fishing is carried on; there
are many settlements of Indians inhabiting huts on piles in
the lake in the ancient fashion. North of the city, Maracaibo,
are <i>salinas</i> or salt deposits, from which several thousand
tons are taken annually. Southwest of Maracaibo, a peculiar
tree is found in the forest, the <i>arbol de vaca</i>, or <i>palo de leche</i>,
the sap of which, though slightly thicker, may be used in
every way as cow’s milk. In the forests are valuable timber,
useful creepers, and trees which furnish various gums or
resins. Around the lake are found outcrops of coal, also
petroleum and asphalt.</p>

<p>The capital city, Maracaibo, is a busy place, and prosperous.
With some good buildings, and other ordinary
requirements, it is in need of better paving, a suitable drainage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
system, and a good water supply, in order to lower its
high death rate and to measure up to its favorable location,
although this may be called hot.</p>

<p><b>Falcón</b>, east of Zulia, extends along the coast of the Gulf
of Venezuela (also called Maracaibo) past the Paraguana
Peninsula, which it includes, and around to the east, so far
that the next coast State, Yaracuy, is on the south together
with the State of Lara farther west; these three States include
the Segovian Highlands; the first two, coast lands also.
This section is the oldest part of Venezuela except for the
town of Cumaná.</p>

<p>An immensely profitable industry here followed is the
raising of goats, which feed on the cactus plains. The extensive
coal deposits and <i>salinas</i> count for little in comparison.
The northern part of the State is rather barren, but the highlands
at the south are forest clad, with fertile valleys raising
a variety of agricultural products, chiefly for home consumption.
There is one considerable river, the Tocuyo, several hundred
miles long, which rises in the mountains of Lara, flows
north, then east through Yaracuy and Falcón to the sea. With
many affluents, the two of importance are the Carora and the
Baragua on the left. The Rio Tocuyo comes down through a
long valley, while many short rivers rising on the outer range
descend rapidly to the sea. The situation is excellent for the
cultivation of <i>cocuiza</i> and other aloes from which sacks and
hammocks are now being made. Other industries are soap
making and cigarettes; in some sections excellent tobacco is
raised.</p>

<p>Coro, the capital of Falcón, the second oldest town in the
Republic, contains the first cathedral in the new world.
Located on the plains at the base of the Paraguana Peninsula,
it is 8 miles from its seaport La Vela and 200 miles
west of Caracas.</p>

<p>The important port Tucacas is at the mouth of the Tocuyo
River.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>The Dutch island, Curaçao, lies not far off the coast,
with which it has close connection; some smuggling is said
to be carried on.</p>

<p><b>Yaracuy</b>, a small State with a very short coastal strip,
is between Falcón on the north and Carabobo southeast,
with Lara southwest. It is noted for its copper mines at
Aroa.</p>

<p>Besides the capital, San Felipe, where a cloth factory
has lately been organized, the chief towns are Nirgua, population
3000, at the south, amid fertile plains with varied agricultural
products, and Yaritagua 20 miles west, where good
tobacco is raised, as well as sugar and coffee which grow
everywhere.</p>

<p><b>Lara</b>, an interior State, borders on Falcón, Yaracuy,
Cojedas, Portuguesa, Trujillo, finishing with Zulia on the
west. Besides the usual agricultural products, there is fibre
from aloes, employed in manufacturing sacks, hammocks,
and bridles, for which Barquisimeto is noted. The fertile
hills and slopes, many now undeveloped, the virgin forests
of valuable timber, with areas where petroleum is indicated,
will receive attention now that better transportation is
afforded.</p>

<p>Barquisimeto, the capital, 2000 feet above the sea, and
90 miles from Puerto Cabello, is the most important city of
this section, a centre of traffic for the northern Andes region
as well as for the State of Lara.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>East of the Segovia Highlands are the States belonging
to the <i>Centro</i>, the section near and including the Federal District.
These are Carabobo, Aragua, and Miranda.</p>

<p><b>Carabobo</b>, east of Yaracuy, has a considerable coast line,
with Aragua east, and Guárico and Cojedes south. Carabobo,
like the states following, is traversed by the Maritime
Andes, having fertile valleys between the two ranges. At
the south are grassy plains pasturing large herds of cattle.
There is virgin territory with forest products of wild rubber,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
timber, and dye woods; to the east the country is more
thickly settled. The state has many agricultural and pastoral
products, with marble quarries in the hills. Near
Guacara 200,000 plants of sisal hemp are cultivated, here
harvested in three years (usually in four), and said to be
superior to the best in Mexico.</p>

<p>Valencia, the capital, is a pleasant city, well situated in
a beautiful and fertile valley, much of which is occupied by
Lake Valencia 30 miles long, with a steamboat service. Having
an altitude of 1600 feet the city has a mild climate and
enterprising inhabitants. The state contains the best port
in the Republic, Puerto Cabello, linked by rail with the
capital, which has another railway connecting it with Caracas.
A small seaport, Ocumare de la Costa, is celebrated
for the excellence of the cacao grown in the vicinity.</p>

<p><b>Aragua</b> stretches from the coast down to the southeast
between Carabobo and Miranda, with Guárico south. In
the state is the east end of Lake Valencia, near which is
the important town of Maracay, population 6000, in the
midst of rich grazing land with pará grass; a splendid farming
and stock raising country, its dairies produce a famous
cream cheese. Goats, and excellent swine for the tropics
are also raised. 15 miles south of Maracay stands Villa de
Cura, in the main pass across the inner range to the llanos.
Here are many big ranches, the altitude being less than
2000 feet.</p>

<p>La Victoria,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the capital, on the Aragua River and also on
the Valencia-Caracas Railway, is 19 miles east of Maracay
and 53 miles from Caracas. It is a prosperous town with
small factories of various kinds.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> Very recently Maracay has been made the capital.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Federal District</b> comprises a long stretch of coast
land with the port, La Guaira, as well as a fertile valley
with fine gardens of luscious fruits, and coffee and sugar
plantations. Some of the coffee trees are said to yield as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
much as 20 pounds annually, which seems a large story; it
is probably two.</p>

<p><b>Miranda</b>, south of the Federal District, has a long strip
of coast land farther east. Anzoátegui is southeast, Guárico
south, and Aragua west.</p>

<p>Ocumare del Tuy, the capital, about south of Caracas,
is on the Rio Tuy, into which the Guaire flows at Santa
Teresa. The broad Tuy valley, here and easterly towards
the coast, is full of sugar cane and cacao. To Guapo farther
east come hides and other animal products from the llanos
as well as rich agricultural produce from the vicinity. Rio
Chico, a town near the coast, is a flourishing manufacturing
place.</p>

<p><b>Anzoátegui</b>, east both of Miranda and Guárico, is a very
large State with a moderate coast line, but with a deep and
wider interior extending down to the Orinoco and Bolívar;
the coast State of Sucre and a long stretch of Monagas are
on the east. In Anzoátegui the llanos come up to the sea,
though the mountains begin again in Sucre.</p>

<p>Barcelona, the capital, is quite a town by the sea, three
miles up the Neveri River, but it makes use of the port,
Guanta, 12 miles distant. Coal mines are near, owned and
operated by Venezuelans, of which fact they are proud, as
many of the industries are in the hands of foreigners. Coffee
and animal products are exported.</p>

<p><b>Sucre</b>, occupying the northeast corner of the Republic,
is the last State on the Caribbean; having the sea west,
north, and east, and the States of Monagas and Anzoátegui
south. Here again we find the double range of the Caribbean
Hills extending across the State.</p>

<p>Cumaná, the capital, dating from 1513, is the oldest
European settlement on the continent; it was the birthplace
of the celebrated patriot, Antonio José de Sucre. The city
is on the south side and at the entrance of the Gulf of
Cariaco, an arm of the sea 50 miles long and 6-7 wide,
which extends east and west, separated from the sea by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
narrow peninsula, Araya. In colonial days rich and prosperous,
the town, population 12,000, has now less than half
as many inhabitants; twice it has been destroyed by earthquakes.
The neighborhood is famous for its fine fruits,
especially grapes, pineapples, and mangoes. The usual
products are brought from the interior for export. The
waters of the eastern, the inner end of the gulf, are covered
with a variety of wild fowls, caught by the peasants for
their plumage; formerly killed by drowning, the men diving
with them under water. Slaughter of birds for their
egrets is now prohibited, other methods for taking the
plumes being practicable. On the west end of the peninsula
are extensive salinas, exporting 6000 tons of salt yearly; on
the south are oil springs.</p>

<p>In this State is the port Carúpano, a city of 11,000, half
way between the peninsulas, Araya and Paria, each a long
point of land, the latter together with the Island of Trinidad
forming the broad Gulf of Paria. Between the Paria Peninsula
and Trinidad, celebrated for its pitch lake 100 acres
in area, is the Bocas del Drago (Dragon’s Mouths) named by
Columbus, through which ships from the north or south pass
to the Port of Spain, Trinidad, and to other points on the
Gulf, though for some the way is nearer through the
Serpent’s Mouth, the southern entrance to the Gulf. Near
the extremity of the finely wooded, mountainous Peninsula
of Paria is Cristóbal Colon, the most easterly port of Venezuela,
opposite the Orinoco Delta. Castro attempted to
make this a rival of the Port of Spain, but the roadstead
is so poor that the money was expended to little purpose.
In Sucre a little north of the San Juan River and near
Guanoco is the great Bermudez Asphalt Lake ten times
the size of the better known Trinidad.</p>

<p><b>Nueva Esparta</b>, the Island State, comprises the larger
Margarita, 20 miles off shore, the smaller Cubagua, Coche
half way between, and other smaller islands. Once famous
for its pearl fisheries which are still in operation, the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
production of ordinary fish, and from Coche of salt is of
equal importance.</p>

<p>La Asunción, the capital, founded in 1524, is in a valley
at the east end of Margarita, with a port, Pampatar, at
which some European liners call.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Llano States</span></h4>

<p><b>Monagas</b>, south of Sucre and east of Anzoátegui, is a
large State, having at the east a small shore on the Gulf
of Paria with the Delta-Amacuro Territory below; on the
south is the State of Bolívar.</p>

<p>Maturín, the capital, population 16,000, a cheerful,
healthful place with the remarkably low death rate of 12 per
1000, is on the Rio Guarapiche, which flows into the Gulf.
This, the most eastern state of the llanos, has probably
the pleasantest part around Maturín, where the grassy plain
is well supplied with streams having deep cut channels and
well wooded banks. The climate too is agreeable. The
State, well watered and wooded, its forests near the northern
hills, is chiefly a cattle country; the owners live mostly
in small towns or villages near the streams, but some in
single, primitive cottages or huts. A hammock must be
carried by the traveler, though food may be procured.</p>

<p><b>Anzoátegui</b>, a coast State as well as a llano, has already
been described.</p>

<p><b>Guárico</b>, a very large State west of Anzoátegui and
north of Bolívar and Apure, is south of Miranda and Aragua,
and has Cojedes and Zamora west.</p>

<p>Calabozo, population 10,000, the capital and chief city,
125 miles southwest of Caracas, is a hot place, but in a good
grazing country. The neighborhood is noted for electric
eels.</p>

<p><b>Cojedes</b>, a smaller State west of Guárico, borders on
Carabobo, Yaracuy, Lara, Portuguesa, and Zamora.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>San Carlos, the capital, is said to be less flourishing than
formerly.</p>

<p><b>Portuguesa</b>, southwest of Cojedes, borders also on Lara,
Trujillo, and Zamora.</p>

<p>Near Guanare, the capital, coffee and cacao are cultivated
as well as the cattle industry.</p>

<p><b>Zamora</b>, also west of Guárico, borders north, west, and
south on Cojedes, Portuguesa, the mountain States of
Mérida and Táchira, and Apure.</p>

<p>Barinas, the capital, is not very prosperous. Formerly
there was here a flourishing tobacco district.</p>

<p><b>Apure</b>, farther south than the other llano States, is west
of Bolívar; with Guárico, Cojedes, Zamora, on the north,
and a bit of Táchira at the west; it has Colombia for a long
distance on its southern boundary.</p>

<p>San Fernando, the capital, with a mean annual temperature
of 91°, and Calabozo, are distinguished as the two hottest
places in the country.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Andine States</span></h4>

<p>These have been called attractive and interesting, but
lacking good means of locomotion have been little visited.
Residents, perhaps returning from Europe, have been
obliged to ride several days on muleback to reach their
homes. Clean, pleasant towns, fine climate and scenery,
mineral wealth, rich forest lands on the upper slopes of the
mountains, people hospitable and energetic, characterize the
three States, but with poor facilities for travel progress was
impossible. Improvement has now begun in this direction,
as the need is realized.</p>

<p><b>Táchira</b>, the most southern of these States, has Zulia
and Mérida north, Zamora and Apure east, and Colombia
south and west.</p>

<p>San Cristóbal, the capital, at an altitude of 3000 feet
is a considerable commercial town. With roads from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
llanos, by which cattle are brought, and others, to San Antonio
on the Colombian frontier, to Uracá, terminus of the
Táchira Railway from Encontrados, and to Mérida, it is
evidently quite a centre of trade.</p>

<p><b>Mérida</b>, preëminently the Mountain State, borders on
Zulia, Trujillo, Zamora, and Táchira. Here are elevated
plains, deep valleys, bleak paramos or high passes, one
reaching 14,500 feet, and loftier snowclad mountains; the
last are east of the capital, Mérida.</p>

<p>Mérida, situated on a plateau a mile above the sea, has
another and lower range of mountains on the west. These
mountain States have the variety of products found in some
States of Colombia: tropical and temperate fruits, with
coffee, cacao, cotton, wheat, wool, etc.; in Mérida, gold
and silver also.</p>

<p><b>Trujillo</b>, with lower mountains, borders on Zulia, Lara,
Portuguesa, Zamora, and Mérida. The fertile valleys produce
the finest cacao, there are large sugar estates; wheat
grows higher, cattle and goats find suitable pasturage.
Northwest are forests largely unexplored; oil springs give
promise of future wealth.</p>

<p>Trujillo, the capital, is a busy town with roads in several
directions; it is 19 miles from the railway station at Motatán.
Other towns of some importance are Valera, Bocono,
and Carache.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The <span class="smcap">Guayana Highlands</span> have a single State and one territory.</p>

<p><b>Bolívar</b>, a great State, with an area of 90,000 square
miles, twice the size of Pennsylvania, has the Delta on the
northeast; north across the Orinoco, it has a bit of Monagas,
a long stretch of Anzoátegui, and a smaller extent of
Guárico, to the point where the Apure enters the Orinoco
and the latter river turns east. There, west of the Orinoco,
is the State of Apure down to the entrance of the Meta
River, below which Colombia is west for a short space.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
Amazonas is south of the west part of Bolivar, and west
of the southeast part, which last has Brazil on the south
and British Guiana east. Bolívar, largely covered with
virgin forest, includes a vast extent of unexplored territory,
besides a gold region bordering on British Guiana.</p>

<p>Ciudad Bolívar, the capital, perhaps a trifle hotter than
the coast ports, has a lower death rate. Two hundred and
twenty-five miles from the mouth of the river, which during
a great part of its course is two miles wide in the dry season
and seven in the wet, the city is located at a point where the
river is narrowed to a mile. In consequence of this, the
water is liable to rise 50 feet in the wet season, flooding the
lower and poorer part of the city.</p>

<p>While the capital is the official port of entry, there is a
city farther down stream known as San Felix or Puerto
Tablas, just beyond the mouth and falls of the Caroni
River. These falls, famed since first seen by Sir Walter
Raleigh, are an imposing spectacle: a huge mass of water
descending over a wall of black granite to the Orinoco
below, obviously a great source of electricity in the future.
East of the Caroni, which flows from the southern boundary,
are the two most populous districts of the State. This is
explained by gold. Cart roads, by which merchandise is
carried south and balatá and hides are brought north, extend
through Upata, capital of the Piar District, to Guasipati,
125 miles; but as the time of wheel traffic may be
ten days and upwards, the traveler usually hires a mule
and arrives in a few days. Guasipati has been the centre
of the balatá industry, but as the local operators lazily
cut down the trees instead of tapping them, the main production
is moving south.</p>

<p>The town of El Callao, 3 hours ride farther, is over the
famous mine of that name. On the border of Guiana 60
or 70 miles south, a section has been opened accessible by
water only. The high cost of transport, and the scarcity,
the high price, and the poor quality of labor, greatly interfere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
with the development of this region. With wide spread
indications of gold, there is little reason to doubt the existence
here of vast mineral wealth.</p>

<p>Besides the forest clad hills of this section there are
great stretches of savannas occupied by or suitable for cattle
ranches, while plantations and mills for the production of
sugar and rum are also found.</p>

<p>Six hours east of Callao, near the forests, is the town
Tumeremo, a centre of the balatá industry, where the wholesale
destruction of trees still prevailing will end local production
and the town as well. The uplands of the Caroni
River are yet unknown, but gold, and the timber and
vegetable products of the forest will doubtless one day
reward the hardy explorer, as in many other regions of
the country.</p>

<p>Above Bolívar, on the Orinoco, there is at one point a
narrow gorge where the current is at times so strong as
to drive back river steamers. Farther on, the Caura River
comes in from the south, through savannas in the lower
part and forests higher up. On a western tributary of the
Caura, the Nichare, there is said to be plenty of good rubber.
130 miles up the Caura are falls or rapids descending 200
feet, a splendid source of power for future saw mills. Two
days higher are more rapids in a narrow gorge. The lower
part of these Orinoco tributaries are infested with mosquitoes,
sand flies, etc., a torment to explorers, but decreasing
upstream. Near the Cuchivero, the next considerable river,
are many cattle ranches; its upper valley is rich in forest
products.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Territories</span></h4>

<p><b>The Amazonas Territory</b>, beginning as previously stated
somewhat below the entrance of the Meta River into the
Orinoco, occupies the entire region south to Brazil. It
extends farther down than the State of Bolívar, having that
State and Brazil on the east, Colombia west, and Bolívar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
also on the north. Amazonas with 101,000 square miles
is larger than Bolívar and still less known, explorers having
attempted little beyond the passage of a few streams.</p>

<p>San Fernando de Atabapo, the capital, is a village where
the Atabapo flows into the Orinoco and that river begins
to be the boundary with Colombia; the Atabapo being the
boundary for some distance farther south. The Orinoco
coming from the southeast, in its upper reaches is entirely
in Amazonas. About the same point as the Atabapo, the
Guaviare enters the Orinoco from Colombia, the white
waters of this stream contrasting with the clear black (one
writer calls it red) of the Atabapo, which latter, it will be
remembered, often indicates absence of mosquitoes with
more comfort and better health.</p>

<p>It is farther north, between the entrance of the Colombian
rivers Vichada and Meta, that the two great barriers
to navigation on the Orinoco occur, the Atures Rapids,
the lower and the largest on the river, and 50 miles south
the Maipures. In each of these sections the foaming river
dashes among rocks and wooded islands in a fashion magnificent
to behold from the shore, but not inviting for a sail.
With the water power apparent, an electric railway connecting
the service of the lower Orinoco with that above
the Maipures Rapids might not seem too difficult; a contract
has been made for the work to promote the development
of this region.</p>

<p>Amazonas contains a mountainous district with peaks
7000-8000 feet high, though the greater part is rather low
land. There are tribes of Indians, some gentle and timid,
others so savage as to prevent exploration, especially the
Guaharibos, also called White Indians, far up the Orinoco
beyond Esmeralda. The territory has grassy plains suited
to cattle raising, but more forest land with rubber trees of
the first class, a few of which in small sections have been
tapped; there are natural cacao patches. Mineral wealth is
indicated by the reports and specimens from the Indians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>Forty miles above the confluence of the Atabapo and the
Guaviare, the great Ventuari tributary, 300 miles long,
enters the Orinoco from the east. 150 miles higher the
famed Casiquiare or Brazo leaves the Orinoco to join the
Rio Negro and Amazon. An old mission station, Esmeralda,
20 miles beyond, on the Orinoco, is the last permanent
settlement of the region. The watershed, here but a slight
bank along the left of the river, is entirely lacking where the
Casiquiare leaves it, taking a little of the water. Farther
on the diverging stream unites with the Guiania River in
Colombia to form the Negro, the chief northern tributary
of the Amazon.</p>

<p><b>The Delta Amacuro Territory</b> embraces the delta of the
Orinoco, with some mountainous country at the south before
reaching the boundary of British Guiana, which with
the State of Bolívar is on the south; Monagas is on the
west. The coast line runs northwest southeast from the
Gulf of Paria, of which it forms the southern limit, to
Guiana; thus nearly the whole coast faces the Atlantic.
Only one settlement is found on the swampy shore, Pedernales
on the Gulf, a gloomy spot with unprepossessing inhabitants.
Up the Caño Pedernales there is beautiful foliage
in the inundated forest, with higher lands back, where live
primitive wild Indians; farther on is unflooded forest, or
open savannas with rich grass for thousands of cattle; on
the banks a few scattered houses. One fine cacao ranch
is passed before reaching Tucupita, the capital, a dismal
place, but with some signs of commercial life. Soon after,
the mountains of Guayana are visible, and presently the
town of Barrancas in Monagas, the lowest town and port on
the Orinoco proper.</p>

<p><b>La Guaira</b>, the chief port of the <i>Centro</i>, and the best
known of Venezuela, is rivaled by Puerto Cabello, which
has a better natural harbor. La Guaira, population 18,000
including its suburbs, as the port of the capital, Caracas,
attracts more travelers and at present more trade, much
of it coming from or going to other parts of the country.
The harbor, a rather open roadstead, was improved at
great expense by port works. Though these facilitate the
increasing traffic, ships at times are still exposed to heavy
swells. The town is hot and unhealthful with a mean temperature
of 84.5°, but it has good rail connection with its
pleasant suburbs, cooler and more sanitary. The port has
good piers, vessels lying alongside. The depth of water is
28-30 feet.</p>

<p><b>Puerto Cabello</b>, 65 miles west, in the State of Carabobo,
population 20,000, is said to have the best harbor, its depth
28 feet, on the North Coast of South America. With a
slightly lower temperature than La Guaira, it has a higher
death rate. To this port comes most of the produce of
its own State, of Yaracuy, of the Llano States Cojedes and
Portuguesa, and some from the Andes region. The enterprise
of the Venezuela Meat Syndicate, with new buildings
here, promotes stock farming and the traffic of the
port. A floating dock receives vessels of 2000 tons; a new
one will accommodate ships of 4000 tons.</p>

<p><b>Carúpano</b>, far to the east of La Guaira, is the only
other port of importance which is visited by large ocean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
steamers. Although as warm as Puerto Cabello, it has a
much more healthful climate. With no real harbor, merely
an open roadstead, serving the State of Sucre, it is a port
of call for several lines of steamers. The cargo must be
transported in lighters.</p>

<p><b>Ciudad Bolívar</b>, though far up the Orinoco River, as
the official port of entry for half the country, serves an
extensive region. It communicates with the outside world
by weekly steamers of shallow draught to the Port of
Spain, as also by coasting vessels. The steamers returning
cross the Gulf of Paria, follow up the Caño Macareo to the
Orinoco, and up that river to Bolívar.</p>

<p><b>Maracaibo</b>, the fifth port with foreign trade, though
called a seaport is not exactly on the sea; being located
on the west shore of a broad channel 6-12 miles wide and
30 long which connects Lake Maracaibo with the Gulf of
Venezuela. The city has fine wharves on a beautiful bay,
a smooth roadstead with water 30 feet deep; but unfortunately
the sand bar at the entrance of the channel confines
the passage to ships drawing only 11 feet, with conditions
growing worse. As the city is now the second port of the
country with the largest export trade including some from
Colombia, it has been proposed either to dredge one of the
entrance channels, or to make use of the fine natural harbor
of Cojoro on the Gulf, capable of accommodating the largest
steamers, and to connect this port with Maracaibo by
a railway about 100 miles long. At present the foreign
trade is carried on by national, Dutch, and Spanish steamers,
and by American boats of the Red D Line. Freight not
destined for the United States is largely carried to the
Dutch Island Curaçao, where transfer is made to ships of
other lines. Sailing vessels also carry much produce.</p>

<p>These primary ports, except Carúpano, all have docks
where ships come alongside. A new freight and passenger
service from New Orleans to Venezuelan ports has been
installed by the W. R. Grace Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>A number of <b>smaller ports</b> are served generally by smaller
craft, steam or sailing vessels, which transfer freight to the
primary ports for ocean traffic. Some of these are: La
Vela (56 miles from Curaçao), the port of Coro, capital
of Falcón; Tucacas, in the same State, important as serving
the copper mines of Aroa; Carenero, in Miranda, east of
Caracas; Guanta, long the port of Barcelona and neighboring
coal mines; Cumaná in Sucre, a mile from the mouth
of the Manzanares River; and Pampatar on Margarita
Island. At Turiamo, a natural harbor between La Guaira
and Puerto Cabello, a public bonded warehouse is to be
erected, and connection will be made with the Grand Central
Railway. At Ocumare de la Costa port and harbor works
are to be constructed by the Government and a railway connecting
the port with Maracay, 43 miles distant.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Inland Transportation</span></h4>

<p>The railway development of Venezuela is small, the
longest line being 111 miles in length, and the total mileage
about 650. There is therefore a little over a foot of railway
for each inhabitant. Most of the lines are from a
port to the interior; all are of narrow gauge, but of varying
widths. Most of the existing lines were laid, 1881-1893.
Unfavorable legislation prevented further construction until
after a change in the laws; later the Great War interfered.
Rates are very high on all the railways, yet most of them
are unprofitable.</p>

<p><b>The La Guaira-Caracas Railway</b> is exceptional, having
a large amount of traffic, more of import freight than of
export. The British-built Railway climbs to a height of
over 3000 feet to surmount the ridge on the south side of
which is Caracas, a two hours’ ride, one of intense interest
and beauty. While the tracks of the Harbor Corporation
are of the same gauge as the railway, these cars do not go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
to the steamer’s side, so that much freight is unnecessarily
handled twice. Railways now electrified serve the suburbs
on either side.</p>

<p>Caracas is served by two other railways, but these are
of different gauge.</p>

<p>The <b>Central Railway</b>, the station of which is two miles
across the city, runs from Caracas east and south towards
Ocumare on the Tuy River; 46 miles to San Francisco de
Yare are completed; the remaining 15 are in construction.
Both of these roads were difficult to build, the many bridges,
tunnels, and viaducts needed making them very expensive.
The maximum grade is about 4 per cent. The latter road
follows down the Guaire valley, passing Petare, a town of
Miranda, only seven miles from Caracas.</p>

<p>If the River Tuy were followed down to the east and
north, one would come to the <b>Carenero Railway</b> which
connects the small port of that name with the towns,
Higuerote, Rio Chico, a flourishing manufacturing place,
and Guapo, 34 miles, on the way to the llanos of Guárico.
From the llanos come hides and other animal products to
the port, and from the vicinity rich agricultural products
including cacao. The Railway runs a steamship line to
La Guaira; small schooners also serve.</p>

<p>The <b>Great Railway of Venezuela</b>, built by the Germans,
is the other line from Caracas, the longest and most costly in
the country. It runs west to Valencia, the second city of
the Republic. Though as a whole less difficult than some
others, there is one stretch of 8 per cent grade requiring
cog wheels and there are many loops and zigzags. The
road traverses a fine farming and cattle country and passes
through the important towns of Victoria and Maracay in
Aragua, previously mentioned. 212 bridges and 86 tunnels
in 111 miles may seem many for an easier road. A branch
of 2¹⁄₂ miles runs to the village of Guigüe.</p>

<p>The <b>Puerto Cabello-Valencia Railway</b>, 33 miles long,
connects Valencia directly with the sea, passing over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
north ridge of the mountains at a height of 2000 feet.
Though the construction of the road as a whole was less
difficult than that of the La Guaira-Caracas, to shorten it,
a section 2.4 miles long has a cog rail with a maximum
grade of 8 per cent.</p>

<p>The <b>Bolívar Railway</b>, farther west, the first in Venezuela,
was built for the especial benefit of the copper mines of the
State of Yaracuy. It runs from the port of Tucacas, northwest
of Puerto Cabello, to Barquisimeto, 100 miles. The
part built first is now a branch of the road, leading from
La Hacha to the rich copper mines at Aroa eight miles
distant. Both railway and mines are British properties, the
latter bringing in handsome returns. A company steamer
carries freight to and from Puerto Cabello, as Tucacas has
no custom house. Another branch of the railway, from
Palma Sola to the capital of Yaracuy, San Felipe, 25 miles,
was opened in 1916. In this State are other copper mines
unworked, and fertile hills and plains uncultivated. The
Rio Tocuyo is navigable as far as Siquisique for steamboats,
but traffic is not sufficient to make their operation
profitable.</p>

<p>The <b>La Vela-Coro Railway</b>, 8¹⁄₂ miles long, connects
Coro with its port.</p>

<p>In the State of Zulia are three more railways:</p>

<p>The <b>La Ceiba</b>, 50 miles long, runs from that port on
the Lake toward the city of Trujillo as far as Motatán.</p>

<p>The <b>Great Railway of Táchira</b>, 75 miles long, goes from
Encontrados on the Catatumbo River west of the Lake,
south towards the capital of Táchira, now reaching San
Felix or a little beyond. It serves the Colombian Department
of Santander as well as Táchira. The many transfers
of freight are a great disadvantage, while freshets on the
Catatumbo threaten to destroy Encontrados.</p>

<p>The <b>Santa Barbara-El Vigia Railway</b>, 37 miles long, is
designed to serve the city of Mérida. Santa Barbara is on
the Escalante River; and the road towards Mérida, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
crosses several streams, has had much trouble from the
Chama River from inundations.</p>

<p>The <b>Guanta-Naricual Railway</b>, far to the east, leads from
the port of Guanta past the city of Barcelona, capital of
Anzoátegui, to the coal mines of Naricual. Guanta, though
not a primary port, has an excellent natural harbor, but
the opening to navigation in 1915 of the Neveri River on
which Barcelona is situated has greatly diminished the traffic
of Guanta.</p>

<p>A few <b>private railways</b> exist, constructed for business
purposes:</p>

<p>A railway 27 miles long of the Asphalt Mines of Inciarte
in Zulia.</p>

<p>A railway of 10 miles of the Asphalt Mines of Guanoco,
Sucre.</p>

<p>A two mile railway of Asphalt Mines of Guanipa,
Monagas.</p>

<p>A railway 10 miles from San Lorenzo, Zulia, to oil wells
of the Caribbean Petroleum Company.</p>

<p>A railway 19 miles from Bobures, Zulia, to a sugar
plantation.</p>

<p>A railway 19 miles from Rio Limón, Zulia, to coal fields
40 miles west of Maracaibo, leased by the Caribbean Coal
Company.</p>

<p>Considerable railway construction is talked of, but the
only immediate probability is of a road from the port of
Castilletes on the Gulf of Venezuela to a coal property near
Lake Maracaibo, belonging to the Caribbean Coal Company.
A port is to be constructed admitting vessels of 35 feet
draft, the present depth being 16 feet. The railway 93 miles
long of standard gauge is to have a one way capacity of
10,000 tons daily, with maximum freight charges lower than
any at this time on existing lines. As no port charges of
any kind are to be collected, if the construction and mining
development are carried out as expected, it will be a most
important industrial development for Venezuela which may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
affect the trade of Curaçao and Maracaibo. As this port
will be but 595 miles from Colon, and as the coal is said
to be of the best quality, it is important for ships making
use of the Canal.</p>

<p>The Venezuelan Government now gives generous concessions
to foreign companies or individuals, undertaking
railway construction.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Other Methods of Communication</span></h4>

<p><b>Roads.</b> Aside from the railways, a meagre supply for a
country of its size, other means of transportation are inadequate.
Street railways exist in the chief cities: Caracas,
Valencia, La Guaira, Puerto Cabello, Maracaibo, Bolívar,
Barquisimeto, Carúpano, and Cumaná. The great water power
available for electric traction and for other purposes should
be largely developed in future. Some automobile and cart
roads exist, 1636 miles at the end of 1919, but to a large
extent transportation is over bridle paths or <i>caminos</i>.</p>

<p>An excellent automobile road leads from La Guaira to
Caracas. From the capital such roads branch in several
directions. One goes east to Guatire, two south to Ocumare
del Tuy, one of these with a branch south from Cua. A good
road leads through Maracay to Valencia; from midway, a
branch leads south through Villa de Cura to Ortiz in
Guárico, from which point construction is being continued
to Calabozo, the capital, and thence to San Fernando, capital
of Apure. Another road leads from Ocumare de la Costa
to Maracay.</p>

<p>From Puerto Cabello one may go by auto to Valencia
and to Guigüe, south of the lake; also from the port to
San Felipe and Barquisimeto.</p>

<p>From the city of Maracaibo a road goes north to San
Rafael near the mouth of the Channel, and one southwest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
to Perija, west of the centre of the Lake, passing two
petroleum sites.</p>

<p>From the terminus of the Táchira Railway, Uracá, a
road leads to San Cristóbal, and one to Cúcuta in Colombia.
From Motatán a good wagon road goes to Trujillo. Pack
animals serve from El Vigia to Mérida. In the east there
is the long road from San Felix on the Orinoco to El Callao
and Tumeremo.</p>

<p>Other roads are in construction or planned for the immediate
future. From Coro a road is to go south and
southwest to Trujillo and beyond, and one near the coast
to Altagracia on the Maracaibo Channel, northeast of that
city. Several roads will branch from Barquisimeto and
from Valencia, the most important, one from Valencia
southwest to San Carlos, Guanare, Barinas, and San Cristóbal.
Shorter local roads will serve Cumaná and Carúpano.</p>

<p>Considerable activity has recently been manifested in
road building; and bridges, long sadly lacking over mountain
torrents, have been constructed. Some deeper streams
have ferries.</p>

<p><b>River</b> communication and lake service are important in
many sections. Of Venezuela’s nearly 500 rivers, 74 are said
to be navigable a distance of 6000 miles, 4000 in the Orinoco
Basin. Especially in Bolívar and Amazonas communication
is by river, but in other States also it is important. The
Orinoco is a natural highway 600 miles to Pericos and the
Atures Rapids. There is regular weekly service to San
Fernando de Apure. There is traffic along the Apure,
Arauca, and Meta Rivers, the last two in Colombia; but
the affluents on the north side of the Orinoco are too variable
in depth to permit regular service, and those on the
south are too broken by cataracts.</p>

<p>On <b>Maracaibo Lake</b> are plenty of craft, both steam and
sailing vessels, two main lines of the former running from
Maracaibo, one along the west side of the Lake and up the
Catatumbo to Encontrados and the Táchira Railway, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
other to La Ceiba and the Motatán Railway going towards
Trujillo on the east side; a smaller boat runs around the
south side of the Lake and up the Escalante to Santa
Bárbara. From Encontrados a line of small steamers runs
up the Zulia to Villamizar.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br><span class="small">VENEZUELA: RESOURCES AND INDUSTRIES</span></h3>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Agriculture</span></h4>

<p>The Agricultural Zone, according to late statistics,
covers the greater part of that section of the Republic which
lies between the sea and the Orinoco Plains: about 100,000
square miles, only one third of which is tilled. The section
has great fertility of soil, and with its varying elevation and
climate it is adapted to the production of everything needful
for man or beast. Twenty per cent of the population
is employed in agricultural pursuits. With the introduction
of new methods and modern machinery a vast development
and great wealth should ensue. At present the chief products
are coffee, cacao, and sugar, with tobacco, cotton, corn,
wheat, vanilla, etc., and a great variety of fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p><b>Coffee</b>, as in Colombia, is called a product of the temperate
clime, growing at an altitude of 1500-6500 feet but
best at 3000. A tree is said to live 50 years and to produce
a quarter to a half a pound annually. About $16,000,000
are invested in the industry; there are approximately 260,000,000
trees. Venezuela claims to be second in coffee
production, exporting over 100,000,000 pounds in 1919.</p>

<p><b>Cacao</b> needs a warmer climate than coffee, and moist
air; hence it grows well on slopes near the sea having a
temperature of 80°. But it is found and cultivated in other
parts, growing wild in Guayana and near the upper Orinoco.
Where cultivated, 80 trees to the acre are approved, of
course at first shaded. After five years two crops a year,
in June and December, are expected. Trees average a life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
of 40 years, with an annual production of 220-250 pounds
an acre. About 16 seeds are enclosed in a long red and
yellow pod, which turns purple when ripe. After being
gathered, they are heaped in piles on the ground, left a
few days to ferment and burst, when the seeds are shelled,
washed, and housed. There are two grades here, the <i>criollo</i>
or native, of very high grade, growing in valleys near the
sea, and the <i>trinitario</i>, imported from Trinidad. The Chuao
Plantation is said to produce cacao of a particularly sweet
and fine quality, which is generally exported to France.
Over $12,000,000 are invested in the business. In production
Venezuela is third. There are more than 5000 plantations.</p>

<p><b>Sugar.</b> The sugar industry is rapidly developing. New
mills with modern machinery have been erected and more
acres are planted. A mill at Maracay can crush nearly
1800 tons of cane daily, with an output of sugar of 80 tons.
Four species of cane are cultivated, the indigenous, the
<i>criolla</i>, most largely, as being sweeter and otherwise giving
good results. The reaping is arranged so that the grinding
may be constant throughout the year. The canes near
Lake Valencia are longer and thicker, with more juice but
less sweetness. The best quality of sugar is produced near
Guatire, three hours by motor from Caracas; the largest quantity
on two plantations near Lake Maracaibo, each having a
daily output of 800 tons.</p>

<p>There are four varieties of products: sugar, brown sugar,
alcohol, and rum, all of which many large plantations are
equipped to produce. Of the two near Bobures, Zulia,
one has 5000 acres under cultivation, the other nearly as
much. The total capital invested is above $10,000,000. An
increasing foreign market is expected.</p>

<p><b>Tobacco</b> is grown in many sections, thriving in humid
fertile soil. It develops in six months, but requires great
care. There is much variety in the quality, some being
strong and heavy, some delicate with fine flavor and aroma.
A little is exported to Havana and there mixed for making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
cigarettes. The annual production, above 3000 tons, might
be increased.</p>

<p><b>Cotton</b> grows wild in many parts of the country, and is
cultivated in a number of States. The average crop is
about 4,000,000 pounds of seeded cotton, half of which is
raised in Aragua and Carabobo. Zulia produces the best
cotton, with longer fibre, nearly one-fifth of the crop. Lara,
Portuguesa, and the States of the East supply the rest.
The cotton is sown in June or July and harvested in the
dry season, December to March. It is freshly planted every
year in connection with vegetables, the receipts from which
cover the cost except for that of gathering; so that the
industry furnishes a desirable opportunity for immigrants
with small or no capital. About $200,000 are invested in
cotton growing.</p>

<p><b>Coconuts</b> are indigenous in Venezuela; and in the regions
of Zulia, Carabobo, Bolívar, Barcelona, and Cumaná, there
are broad plantations. Over $1,000,000 is invested.</p>

<p><b>Wheat</b> is grown to some extent and fine crops are produced;
but much more land is available in the high table-lands
and valleys of Western Venezuela so that home consumption
could easily be supplied. With improved methods,
machinery, etc., it might even become a staple export.</p>

<p><b>Corn</b> is cultivated everywhere in all kinds of soil from
sea level up to 9000 feet, but it grows best between 1500
and 3000 feet. About 75,000 acres are devoted to its production;
150,000 tons are raised, some being exported. It is
the real bread plant of the country especially in the interior.</p>

<p><b>Beans</b> in large variety are produced, black beans being
greatly in demand and some exported.</p>

<p><b>Indigo</b> was once cultivated and in 1802 was exported to
the value of $2,500,000, but its production was abandoned
owing to higher returns from coffee.</p>

<p><b>Vanilla</b> grows well in the rich lands of Falcón, Lara,
Bolívar, Zamora, and Anzoátegui. Its cultivation might be
developed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Forestry</span></h4>

<p>The forest resources are inexhaustible but hardly
touched, the zone comprising about half of Venezuela of
which 98 per cent is virgin territory. Nearly three-quarters
of this area is public land, over 100,000 square miles. With
more capital and labor, better means of transport, and
modern implements and machinery a great development
will result. The chief forest products are rubber, balatá,
tonka beans, divi-divi, and various medicinal plants. There
are many dyeing and tanning plants, and gums and resins
abound. In the forests a great amount of timber exists
including the finest varieties; but as usual these are scattered,
and with present facilities, difficult to get out with a
profit. Of the 600 species of wood 5-10 per cent are marketable.
145 varieties used for ornamental purposes and 20
kinds of woods and barks suitable for dyeing and tanning
were exhibited at the Chicago Exposition in 1893. The
great mora tree, three feet in diameter, is excellent for ship
building; mahogany, rosewood, and other trees of hard wood
abound.</p>

<p><b>Rubber</b>, chiefly of the hevea variety, is found and exported
both from the Casiquiare-Amazon section and more
from Yuruary in East Bolívar. It is cultivated near Ocumare
del Tuy, each tree there giving 460 grams of juice, 95
per cent pure rubber. Several million people are needed
to exploit the industry, in which $1,200,000 has been invested.</p>

<p><b>Balatá</b>, procured from forest trees in a manner similar to
rubber, is allied to gutta percha, and is employed with this
for many purposes.</p>

<p><b>Divi-divi</b>, one of the best and cheapest plants for tannin,
grows wild throughout the country, chiefly along the
coast and on the edge of the llanos at the foot of the south
slope of the Coast Mountains. Hot lowlands with a minimum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
average of rain suit it best. It grows to a height of
20-30 feet. The brown pods three inches long contain 30-40
per cent of tannin, sometimes even 50. The seeds have
little. In wet weather the tannin is liable to sudden fermentation
especially in electrical storms, when the tanning is
impeded, and the leather may be stained. Some trees 90
years old still produce a full crop. Near Cumaná, a tree
may yield 275 pounds a year, but in the west, 25-50 pounds
only. It is an extremely cheap source of tannin though
not largely used. Venezuela probably has more frequent
stands of this tree than any other country. 5000 men are
said to leave Ciudad Bolívar yearly for its collection in the
interior. As cultivated in Curaçao plantations, the pods
have 20 per cent more tannin and bring 25 per cent higher
price.</p>

<p><b>The Mangrove</b> bark is another important source of
tannin; the tree growing in swampy ground is useful in
reclaiming land at the ocean’s edge. The bark has 22-33
per cent tannin, the leaves nearly 20, the wood some. The
stands are unlimited in number.</p>

<p><b>The Tonka Bean</b>, a black almond with delicious perfume,
is the fruit of the serrapia tree. The beans are used in
the preparation of chewing tobacco and in making perfumes.
The price varies from 50 cents to $5 a pound. This
is a staple of great value in the Orinoco forests, but many
gatherers die of fever or starve. A few concessions have
been granted for the cultivation of tonka trees, in the public
lands of the Caura district. In one year over $700,000
worth of the beans were exported.</p>

<p><b>Chicle</b>, used to make chewing gum, comes from the sap
of a tree called <i>pendare</i> which has a delicious fruit, <i>sapodilla</i>.
The tree may be tapped continuously 8-15 years. The sap is
boiled in the forest.</p>

<p><b>The Caoba</b> or mahogany tree grows from sea level to
about 3000 feet. It may be seen along the streets of Valencia.
It grows to a height of 130 feet with a diameter of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
four feet at the base. It is exported to Europe and to the
United States.</p>

<p><b>The Moriche Palm</b> grows in clumps on the llanos. From
the sap the Indians make wine, vinegar, oil, soap, starch;
and from the leaves, hats, clothes, hammocks, baskets, mats,
etc.</p>

<p><b>Fibre plants</b> of superior quality exist in great variety
and quantity. Among these are the cocuiza sisal called
equal or superior to the sisal (hemp) of Yucatan; ramie,
<i>jipijapa</i>, flax, and other varieties.</p>

<p>Plants for making paper grow in profusion, desirable for
use rather than wood to save the destruction of forests. The
most abundant and desirable is bamboo, but many other
plants are serviceable including the residue from sugar cane.
The by-product of three tons of sugar would be roughly two
tons of fibre, worth about $120. Bitter cane and other
rushes might be so used, either exported as pulp, or in some
localities made into paper.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Cattle Industry</span></h4>

<p><b>Goats</b> have been spoken of as raised with great profit
on the well adapted lands near Barquisimeto, comparatively
high, and on lowlands in the regions of Coro and Maracaibo.</p>

<p><b>Cattle.</b> The cattle industry has still greater possibilities.
The pastoral zone extends from Barrancas to Colombia and
from the Vichada River to the mountains in Carabobo.
While a portion of the llanos like those in Colombia suffers
from severe drought in the summer, and though in places
the grass is thin, in this immense region there is room for
an enormous number of cattle where the grasses are rich.
Hence stock raising can be carried on to great advantage.
There is some difficulty in transportation, but this is gradually
improving, and with the erection of more packing and
slaughter houses, and with improvements in breeding, the
industry has a sure future. Some stock raisers, especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
General Gomez, have made great efforts for improvement,
importing full blooded cattle of different breeds to produce
a better kind, perfectly adapted to the climate of Venezuela.
Modern methods are being employed, and in the valley of
Maracay a large number of live stock is fattened ready to
supply the 500 cattle daily killed at Puerto Cabello by the
Refrigerating Company which exports them. A new packing
house is to be erected at Turiamo. It is reported that
a contract has been made for 200,000 acres to be colonized
by Germans, who wish to control the meat packing industry.
The number of cattle in Venezuela is estimated at 3,000,000.</p>

<p><b>Sheep</b>, <b>horses</b>, <b>hogs</b> are also raised in the valley of
Maracay; acclimated specimens of special breeds have been
obtained for reproduction in other parts of the country. At
present horses and mules are raised in comparatively small
numbers.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Mining</span></h4>

<p>There is hardly a precious metal or valuable mineral
which does not exist in Venezuela, though little has been
done to exploit them. Gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, antimony,
tin, quicksilver, asphalt, petroleum, coal, sulphur,
asbestos, platinum, diamonds, and other precious stones are
found; 25 years ago 226 deposits had been located: 62 gold,
29 coal, 14 copper, 10 iron, etc.</p>

<p><b>Gold</b>, the most exported metal, while found in every
State, has been chiefly sought and profitably worked in
Guayana, where in the Yuruary region considerable mining
has been done. True alluvial belts are found, zones of shale,
and quartz veins. The alluvial deposits known are mainly
near the British Guiana border in the Cuyuni and El Dorado
districts. Placer gold exists along the Caroni River and in
smaller tributaries of the Orinoco above Ciudad Bolívar.
The rock formation shows the gold to be in stingers and
crystalline grains of arsenical pyrite, from which the placers
and pockets have been formed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>The quartz veins are more northerly near El Callao,
where $50,000,000 are said to have been produced in thirty
odd years. One mine in the Yuruari district has yielded
35,000 ounces. Metal is found in pockets 50-100 feet deep
about 150 miles from the Orinoco. An English company has
mining claims west of El Callao, where the ore is treated
with quicksilver and cyanide, yielding 1-4 ounces per ton.
Another company is working on the La Paz Bonanza, where
10,000 ounces were taken out by crude methods from rich
veinlets and pockets almost at the surface. Several other
companies are engaged, French and Venezuelan, one along
the Cicapra River, a branch of the upper Yuruari. It is
estimated that several million cubic yards with an average
yield of $1.00 each are here available at a cost of 50 cents
per yard. With better transportation and other facilities
this section may come into the front rank of gold mining
districts in South America. At present it is said to be
better adapted to individual operators than to large companies.
The climate is not unhealthful if suitable precautions
are taken. The country is well wooded except near Callao.
The average yearly production of gold is 900,000 grams.</p>

<p><b>Copper</b> is known to exist in several States: Falcón, Carabobo,
Mérida, Lara, a rich deposit in the northern part of
Cojedes; but the only one vigorously and very profitably
operated is that of Aroa in Yaracuy, where dividends have
been 75-350 per cent. Near Nirgua in the same State other
copper mines have been worked.</p>

<p><b>Coal</b> is found in various sections. Where outcroppings
occur in Táchira, Mérida, and Trujillo small operations have
been carried on. There are other deposits but the principal
mines worked are in Sucre and Falcón. Naricual, 16 miles
from Barcelona, has produced the most coal, but not of a
very good quality. It is used on local steamers and railways,
and some, with pitch from Trinidad, is made into
briquettes. A little west, another mine with coal of better
quality has been opened within five miles of tide water on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
the bank of a river. The mines of Falcón near Coro have
been developed further and production is increasing. Coke
ovens have been established. Coal is found in several
places near Lake Maracaibo. In the deposit 60 miles northwest
of Maracaibo the coal is of high grade, better than
Middle West coal and equal to the Pocahontas; hard, bright,
black, excellent for steaming. Some veins are 8-20 feet
thick, and when the railway to Castilletes is completed the
annual export is expected to reach 500,000 tons. Lignite,
bituminous, and semi-anthracite varieties are found.</p>

<p><b>Iron</b> ore deposits occur in the eastern hills or mountains
south of the Delta, but in the Delta Territory at Imataca.
It is 67 per cent pure and almost free from sulphur and
phosphorus. In 1914 some Americans secured options. Iron
is also found near Coro, Barinas, Barcelona, and Cumaná.</p>

<p><b>Salt</b> is found on the island of Coche, on the peninsula of
Araya near Cumaná, in the vicinity of Barcelona and of
Maracaibo, and elsewhere.</p>

<p><b>Sulphur</b> appears to exist in commercial quantities about
11 miles inland from Corúpano; and other minerals have
been observed in various States.</p>

<p><b>Diamonds and Pearls.</b> There are said to be diamond
mines in the Orinoco region. Pearl fishing is carried on
among the islands, about 1600 persons being so engaged.
Rakes are now used as diving is prohibited. Recently
$600,000 worth were exported within a few months.</p>

<p><b>Asphalt</b>, found in the Bermudez Pitch Lake five miles
from Guanoco in the State of Sucre, is an important source
of wealth. This lake, the largest known deposit in the
world (1100 acres), has more than ten times the area of the
famous Trinidad Lake, though it is not so deep. It is regarded
as the residue of evaporated petroleum, the asphalt
here representing the outflow of 80,000,000 barrels of oil.
The flow continues, the oil spreading over the lake and replenishing
it. This with active seepages near indicates enormous
oil bearing formations below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>The General Asphalt Company and its subsidiaries have
a 30 year lease of nearly 12,000 acres including the lake.
The structure of the lake includes faulting, folding, and
fracturing of strata, with formations of black shale, sandstone,
and fossiliferous limestone, the last supposed to be
the source of the oil, and the sandstone its reservoir, whence
from pressure of gas it escapes to the surface. A narrow
gauge railway is in use. From lack of transport hardly
20,000 tons of asphalt were shipped from Bermudez Lake
in 1920 compared with over 40,000 in 1919; from Trinidad
Lake, about 70,000 in 1919 and over 108,000 in 1920. In
the Bermudez concession is a large asphalt deposit 100-200
yards across, on the Island of Capure in the Orinoco Delta.</p>

<p>In the Maracaibo Basin are other beds. One near the
Lake at Inciarte, 27 miles from navigable water, is 94 per
cent pure; but transportation is difficult.</p>

<p>The <b>Petroleum</b> prospects of Venezuela are excellent.
The chief work accomplished is in the Maracaibo Basin,
which is regarded as one of petroleum as well as of water.
Many companies are engaged in development work. After
two years of preliminary examination by 35 experienced
geologists, the Caribbean Petroleum Company selected 1000
areas averaging 1250 acres each for further investigation.
Of these they now retain 250, covering 312,500 acres. With
a lease concession for 30 years, a tax of eight cents an acre
is paid annually and a royalty equal to about ten per cent
on oil shipped from the country. On one section, the Mene
Grande Field, ten miles east of Lake Maracaibo to which
a road through swamps was built, about a dozen wells have
been drilled, in all of which oil has been found. The first
were capped, but with present facilities flow is permitted.
The character of the oil improves with depth. Three 55,000-barrel
steel tanks have been erected, and pumping stations
on the field and at the port. A pipe line was laid 11 miles
to the shore at San Lorenzo, where, 70 miles southeast of
Maracaibo, storage tanks and a refinery were built. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
latter, now in operation, will refine every grade of oil except
lubricants. The capacity is 2000 barrels daily (42 gallons
each). One well is said to rank in output with some of the
Mexican. Much of the oil is now used by some Venezuelan
railways, and by industries of the country. Part of the
crude oil is carried by three barges and eight converted
monitors of 450-500 tons each to a refinery at Curaçao,
which has larger storage tanks, pumping station, etc. The
refinery has been running 1000 tons of crude oil daily, but
can take care of 4000 tons. The swift current of the Maracaibo
Channel makes management of the monitors difficult.
This Company has other wells at Perija, 50 miles west of
the Lake. The first, which struck oil at 1227 feet, was shut
in. One in the Limón Field, drilled to 2752 feet, was abandoned.</p>

<p>Other companies have concessions for work near the
Lake, at the east, south, and southwest. One was hampered
by wild Indians, compelling the employment of armed
guards, another by extremely unhealthful conditions; but
both after some unsuccessful work have found promising
wells. The Colon Developing Company, with a large property
100 miles west of Encontrados and near the Colombian
border, has struck oil at less than 1300 feet, close to
the Rio de Oro. Two thousand barrels of high grade oil
were produced within 24 hours, but as no facilities for transport
existed the well was capped. This oil is said to be of
quality superior to that east of the Lake, which is better
than the Mexican.</p>

<p>East of the Lake, another field, north of the Mene
Grande, is owned by the Venezuelan Oil Concessions. Wells
drilled here have passed through three oil bearing sands;
the deeper, the better and lighter the oil. One has spouted
80 feet high; another over the top of the derrick. An area
of several square miles is proved. This Company has 3000
square miles of oil bearing land near the Lake for 50 years.
In Mexico wells producing 100,000 barrels a day are seen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
The general manager of this Company believes the Venezuelan
wells will be bigger.</p>

<p>The Venezuelan Falcón Oil Syndicate, which has a 50
year concession of over 2000 square miles in Falcón, expects
to open up many fields. Pipe lines could converge and refineries
be installed within 50 miles of the farthest point.
The first well drilled is 37 miles from the seaboard. Motor
tractors are employed. The British Controlled Oilfields has
taken over the Bolívar Concessions, which has the right to
bore in 7,000,000 acres in Falcón.</p>

<p>On the Island of Trinidad 362,800 barrels of crude petroleum
were produced in 1920. Near this Island, corresponding
to the oil region at the northwest of Venezuela, is one
at the northeast around the Gulf of Paria, especially at the
south, and comprising the Orinoco Delta. Here is found
the heavier form of petroleum in large quantities. Some
wells have been drilled on the Peninsula of Paria with no
good result. The Guanoco Field, south, is believed to cover
the axis and flanks of the Guanoco anticlines, of which the
southern is thought to be responsible for the great oil seepages
of the Asphalt Lake. The field is believed to extend
60 miles southwest, to and beyond the San Juan River. The
first well was drilled (1912) in the Lake. Heavy oil, specific
gravity 1.02, was found under enormous gas pressure, making
operations difficult. Production of 1000 barrels a day
was secured at 615 feet, but the well was closed to avoid
waste. Later it produced in three months 50,000 barrels.
Other wells have been drilled in the vicinity, also on Pedernales
Island in the Delta; the oil from the latter of lighter
gravity. For some purposes the heavy oil is of special value.
It is too heavy to pump, but the strong gas pressure makes
it available. The areas are swampy, difficult to work, and
unhealthful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Manufactures</span></h4>

<p>As might be expected, the manufacturing industries of
Venezuela are few in number and rely in the main on a
protective tariff for existence. The principal articles made
are cotton goods, paper, glass, cement, cordage, soap,
candles, shoes, alpargatas, leather goods, cigars, cigarettes,
etc. The five cotton factories produce 80 per cent of the
ordinary cloth consumed in the country. In Mérida are
woolen and hat factories. In Caracas good furniture is
made, macaroni, paper, etc. There is a paper factory also
at Maracay. Ten miles from Caracas the waterfall of Naiguatá,
over 3000 feet, makes available 30,000 horse power, of
which 9000 is used.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Investments</span></h4>

<p>Among the various opportunities for the investment of
foreign capital, including all of the industries mentioned, the
safest are agriculture and stock raising; perhaps also small
factories. Land is so cheap that little capital is needed
for the agriculturist unless engaging on a very large scale.
Coffee, cacao, sugar cane, castor beans, and many other
articles may be raised with profit. Factories large or small
may be operated to advantage. Cumaná and Puerto Cabello
are good places for canning tropical fruits. Oil may be extracted
for edible or industrial purposes from coconuts, peanuts,
and other fruits or vegetables. Chocolate may be
made, cotton mills established. A mill is suggested for
Margarita, where fine cotton is grown. Rope and bag factories
might employ Venezuelan <i>cocuiza</i> or henequen to make
the 2,000,000 bags needed annually in the country. Saw
mills at Cumaná, Maracaibo, La Ceiba, Tucacas, etc., would
be extremely useful.</p>

<p>Large capitalists may find opportunities for the construction
of public utilities such as street railways, electric light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
and power plants, water works, sewers; also in bridge building,
railway construction, etc. Some might be interested in
mining, especially of iron, which is found favorably located
for transportation within half a mile of a navigable river
about 50 miles from the mouth of the Orinoco. To individuals
with small capital the gold region would be more
attractive. An important development of the large deposits
of bauxite is attracting much attention.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br><span class="small">GUIANA AS A WHOLE: BRITISH GUIANA</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The name Guiana has been applied to the entire country
between the Orinoco and the Amazon. We have observed
that in Venezuela the region south of the Orinoco is called
the Guiana Highlands. We shall notice later that the section
south of the dividing mountain range and north of the
Amazon as far west as the Rio Negro is called Brazilian
Guiana; but the country which is more strictly Guiana is
east and north of these, though here, too, adjectives are applied
as there are three divisions: British, Dutch, and
French Guiana, the British on the west, the French farthest
east.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Area</span></h4>

<p>The area of them all is about 170,000 square miles, of
which British Guiana has 90,000, Dutch 46,000, and French
33,000 square miles.</p>

<p>As these countries are colonies instead of republics their
governments are naturally different.</p>

<p>Although sighted by Columbus in 1498 and visited not
long afterward by traders, as there was a large Indian population,
the country was settled later than Venezuela and
Colombia. After various vicissitudes the earliest colonies
were abandoned. The difficulties of the later settlements,
the changes, insurrections, massacres, wars, and troubles
of various kinds following are too numerous to recount, and
we come immediately to conditions of the present time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Physical Characteristics</span></h4>

<p>The three divisions of Guiana are similar, having first
a low marshy coast land, rising at the back very slightly
for a distance of 10 to 40 miles. A broader, more elevated
tract of sandy or clayey soil follows with a still higher
region in the rear. Of the southern section the eastern part
is almost all forest, the central and southwest portions have
more grass clad savannas, which might support thousands
of cattle if there were any way to get them out. There is
a vast network of water ways, many rivers in their lower
sections near the coast being connected by <i>caños</i>. The forest
varies, being dense in river bottoms and thin on sandy soils.
The longest river, the Essequibo, is about 600 miles, others
a little less. At from 50 to 100 miles inland, all the rivers
are blocked by rapids, but some are accessible to large
vessels as far as these. There are various hills and mountains,
the highest, the Pacaraima Range, marking in part the
boundary with Venezuela, the Acarai Mountains with
Brazil; the two form the water shed between the Amazon,
the Orinoco, and the Essequibo rivers. Mt. Roraima, altitude
8635 feet, rising as a red rock 1500 feet above the forest,
is said to have as its top a tableland of 12 square miles.
Several other mountains are from 7000 to 8000 feet high.
Ranges of hills and mountains from 2000 to 3000 feet traverse
the country elsewhere. In Dutch and French Guiana
are almost impenetrable forests, less explored than those of
British Guiana, especially towards the south. A splendid
waterfall is the Kaieteur, nearly five times as high as Niagara,
741 feet, with 81 feet of cataracts just below, in the midst
of lovely tropical vegetation. Many other beautiful falls
of less height, and cascades provide an immense amount of
water power.</p>

<p>The climate is considered good in most places though
there is large rain-fall, at Georgetown averaging 93 inches
a year, in some places 100; but there is no yellow fever,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
and other diseases except in certain localities may be
guarded against.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">British Guiana</span></h4>

<p><b>Area.</b> This colony has an area of 90,000 square miles,
exceeding that of Great Britain, a sea coast of 270 miles,
and a depth varying from 300 to 535 miles.</p>

<p>The <b>Population</b> according to the official report of 1919
is 310,000.</p>

<p><b>Boundary.</b> British Guiana has the Atlantic Ocean on
the northeast, Dutch Guiana east, the Corentyn River serving
most of the way as the boundary line; Brazil is on the
south, and Brazil and Venezuela are west.</p>

<p><b>The Government</b> is practically that of a Crown Colony
with a Governor who has almost absolute power. He is
assisted by a legislative council which has no great influence.</p>

<p><b>The Population</b> is mixed, East Indians and negroes
forming by far the greater proportion of the total, some
mestizos, Chinese, Indians, and 10,000 whites. The large
majority of the people live in the coastal belt. Many negroes
were brought from Africa as slaves, who, after their emancipation,
in large numbers refused to work on the plantations
as before. East Indians were then brought in, who
though not so strong are more industrious and have better
health than those of other races; for one reason because
they dress to suit the climate, draping themselves with a few
yards of cotton cloth in a really artistic manner. The native
Indian is useful to the traveler as boatman, wood-cutter, or
huntsman, also to gold diggers, and seekers of balatá. Some
of the half civilized are fairly reliable. If they become
friends they are of great value. The wild Indians are disappearing,
perhaps going farther back.</p>

<p><b>Education</b> is mainly carried on by religious denominations,
with missions in outlying districts; 224 schools receive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
government assistance; there is one government free school
in Georgetown where students may be prepared for English
universities or for ordinary fields of labor. Of course there
is full religious liberty, but the government subsidizes the
principal churches, especially the English and Scotch, in the
country the parishes alternating. The Roman Catholic and
the Methodist churches also receive annual grants. Other
denominations are represented, but receive no assistance
except in some cases for schools.</p>

<p>The <b>Post Office</b> is up to date with telephone (1800 miles
of wire), telegraph (575 miles), and savings bank attachments,
the last having over a million dollars on deposit.
There is cable communication with the West Indies and
wireless. British money is not in general use; dollars and
cents according to the decimal system of America are the
common currency. The weights and measures are naturally
British like our own.</p>

<p><b>The Capital</b> of British Guiana, Georgetown, population
54,000, located at the mouth of the Demerara River, is a
tropical garden city with broad streets, interesting stores,
a club, a museum, a curious market. On account of dampness
the houses are all built on pillars. The city has 50 miles
of paved streets with good tramways, etc.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Ports and Transportation</span></h4>

<p>The chief ports of the Guianas are the three capitals, which
are connected with the outside world by the West Indies Mail
Services of the three mother countries, while other steamship
lines run regularly to London, Liverpool, and Glasgow. There
is mail service with Canada and regular steamers from New
York. Coast and river steamers ply regularly along the coast
of British Guiana from the northwest extremity to the Berbice
River, at the mouth of which is the city of New Amsterdam,
called a smaller Georgetown, not very far from the
boundary of Dutch Guiana. The country has 95 miles of railway,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
450 of navigable rivers, 39 miles of canals, and 322 of
good roads.</p>

<p>A railway 60 miles long connects Georgetown with New
Amsterdam, <i>i.e.</i>, it reaches a point on the Berbice River opposite
the latter city. Five miles of this road from Georgetown
to Plaisance, completed and opened for traffic in 1848, is
actually the oldest railway in South America. Another 19
mile line goes from Vreeden Hook opposite Georgetown on
the Demerara River to Greenwich Park on the Atlantic at
the mouth of the Essequibo. Another short line running
through primeval forest has been laid from Wismar on the
Demerara, 65 miles from its mouth, to Rockstone on the
Essequibo to give access to the upper part of the latter river
above extensive and dangerous rapids, and further to the
Potaro and other gold fields. The Road, besides passenger
and tourist traffic handles a variety of timber. Its owners,
(Sprostons Ltd.), who employ over 1000 men, maintain a
coast and river service, and own a foundry, lumber yard,
etc. A railway to the Brazil boundary, long planned, would
open up the interior and its valuable resources. From Rockstone,
launches run 90 miles up the river to Potaro Landing.
A service was to be organized to the Kaieteur Falls on
the Potaro River.</p>

<p>Ferries cross the mouths of the three principal rivers,
the Essequibo, the Demerara, and the Berbice. The estuary
of the Essequibo River is 15 miles wide. It contains several
large islands, on some of which are plantations. Vessels
drawing less than 20 feet can enter the river and go up 50
miles. The mouth of the Demerara River, two miles wide,
has a sand bar prohibiting the entrance of vessels drawing
more than 19 feet. To such as enter, the river is navigable
for 70 miles. The Berbice River, two miles wide at its
mouth, is navigable 105 miles for vessels drawing 12 feet
and 175 miles for boats drawing 7 feet. The Corentyn River
with an estuary 14 miles wide is navigable for 150 miles; this
river is the boundary between British and Dutch Guiana.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
Roads good enough for automobiles and carriages, which
use them, extend from the Corentyn River along the coast
some miles beyond the mouth of the Essequibo and a few
miles up the rivers.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Resources</span></h4>

<p>At present agriculture and mining are the leading industries.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Agriculture</span></h4>

<p><b>Sugar</b>, the chief source of revenue for the colony, in
slavery days brought great wealth to the planters; but after
the emancipation some estates were divided, the negroes
refused to work steadily if at all, and production greatly
declined. At length East Indians who were imported helped
to revive the industry. Of 105,000 agricultural laborers
73,000 are East Indians. The plantations are mostly in the
coastal lowlands where 77,000 acres are cultivated. Attention
to the dams needed to keep out the sea in front and
water from the morass at the side, also to the drainage
ditches, necessary on account of the sudden rains, occasionally
ten inches a day, adds much to the labor, as they
demand incessant care. The value of the product in 1916
including sugar and rum was estimated at $15,000,000 or
more. Demerara sugar has long been famous; the soil is
extremely fertile.</p>

<p><b>Rice</b>, to which 60,000 acres are devoted, and which the
East Indians especially consume, is next to sugar in importance.
Formerly 39,000,000 pounds were imported annually,
while in 1916, about 70,000,000 pounds were produced
and 30,000,000 exported. The largest producer is an
American company. The value of the rice exported in 1916
was over $1,000,000. The quality is superior to the East
Indian.</p>

<p><b>Coconuts.</b> Increasing attention is paid to raising coconuts.
Thirty thousand acres of the trees, which seem to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
enjoy the sea breeze, have been planted. In one year
2,000,000 nuts and 180,000 pounds of copra, dried coconut,
were exported, also coconut oil, the value of all the products
shipped being $45,000. This will be greatly increased when
all the trees come into bearing.</p>

<p><b>Cacao.</b> The culture of cacao, as yet unimportant, is
increasing. It grows well in the river bottoms of the forest
region, but does not like the sea breezes. It may, however,
be protected from these on the coast lands by a wind break
of tall trees.</p>

<p><b>Coffee</b> also has been neglected though about 240,000
pounds were exported in 1914. Its quality is said to be
equal to that of Trinidad or Caracas.</p>

<p><b>Pará rubber</b> is cultivated in plantations on river lands
and immediately back of the coast, more than 6000 acres
being planted; but as yet little has been exported.</p>

<p>The <b>plantain</b>, beloved by the negro, and praised for its
food value, is grown in enormous quantities. The unripe
fruit is usually eaten boiled, but is better fried, or roasted
and buttered. Sliced, dried, and ground, it is thought by
some to be superior to arrowroot or sago.</p>

<p>Other tropical fruits might be grown for export, oranges,
limes, mangoes, pineapples, <i>sapodilla</i> called luscious, guava,
<i>cassava</i> biscuit, etc. The <i>saouri</i> nut which grows in the forest
one writer calls the most delicious nut in the world.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Forests</span></h4>

<p>About five-sixths of the country is forest land, nearly all the
property of the government. These 78,000 square miles of
timber are largely inaccessible on account of the numerous
waterfalls and rapids of the rivers; a railway line to the remote
interior is of the utmost importance. The timber and lumber
trade is slight, though the <i>greenheart</i>, a wood of great strength,
weighing 75 pounds the cubic foot, is sought for its use in
the construction of docks, heavy flooring, etc. The trees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
which grow in clay soil near rivers and creeks supply logs 18
by 24 inches, 70 feet long. Most of it is shipped to Panamá
where it was used in the locks; 40 to 60 varieties of trees are
found on an acre. The export of <i>balatá</i> is important, only
sugar, rum, and gold preceding it in value, nearly $1,000,000
worth in a year. It is a kind of gutta percha much used for
belting. The tree is tapped the same way as a rubber tree.
Licenses are granted for certain forest areas and the country
is ranged over by prospectors and tappers. Over 1,000,000
pounds are produced. The milk resembles that of the cow,
and is sometimes used for coffee, but it is believed to be unwholesome.
A tree usually yields one gallon, which produces
five pounds of balatá, but some trees five gallons. The trees
must not be tapped oftener than once in four years.</p>

<p>In the forest are found various gums and balsams, the
<i>copaiba</i>, the tonka bean, the basis of many perfumes, vanilla,
nutmeg, oils from palm nuts, and most important, the <i>caraba</i>
oil which is used by the Indians to lubricate their bodies and
to dress the hair for the purpose of warding off noxious insects
and vermin. It has a strong unpleasant odor, doubtless arising
from its valuable properties. Light woods suitable for paper
are found and many others of value. There is a variety of
fibre plants, agave, pineapple, <i>pita</i> hemp, and others, some of
which might be utilized to save the great importation of rice
and sugar bags. There is an inexhaustible supply of pulp
material for the manufacture of paper.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Mining</span></h4>

<p><b>Mining</b> is an important industry in Guiana, the mineral
wealth being chiefly in gold and diamonds, though recently
<i>bauxite</i>, valuable as a source of aluminum and for other purposes,
has been found in what promises to be paying quantities.</p>

<p>Gold mining was prosecuted in the 17th and 18th centuries,
but not much in the 19th till 1857 when some activity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
began in the Yuruán district and later along the Cuyuni
River. In the former a nugget of 180 ounces was obtained.
By 1885 the industry had become important and an American
prospector finding 275 pounds of gold created much
excitement. Later a nugget of 333 ounces, worth over
$6500, was discovered at Barima. Most of the gold has
been taken, largely by Indians, from alluvial diggings;
some dredging has been successful. In 25 years nearly
3,000,000 ounces were mined. In 1913 the output was from
ten different river districts. A good recent find was near
Pigeon Island on the Cuyuni. Most of the districts are so
difficult of access that scientific mining with modern machinery
is almost impossible. In 1915 about 54,000 ounces
were produced and since 1890 over $40,000,000.</p>

<p>A new gold field discovered by American prospectors
is between the head of the Takutu River and the Tucurutu
Mountains.</p>

<p>Many diamonds are found but mostly small. In 13
years from 1900 over 1,000,000 stones weighing 85,800 carats
were produced; in 1915 6200 carats valued at $51,000.</p>

<p>The discovery of oil in several places has been rumored,
the most favorable indications being in the Waini River
district. Blocks of bitumen found off the coast seem to
indicate another pitch lake, and asphalt is said to have been
located near the coast, though not yet worked. White
quartz sand suitable for glass making and <i>kaolin</i> for pottery
exist in quantity, forming reefs and sand hills.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Other Industries</span></h4>

<p>Cattle raising has great possibilities but slight development.
There are 112,000 head of cattle.</p>

<p>The waters have several hundred species of fish, many
well flavored and worth salting. Isinglass or fish glue is
exported.</p>

</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Dutch Guiana</span></h4>

<p>This country, sometimes called Suriname, about the size
of New York State, by the Peace of 1667 was conceded to
the Netherlands, Great Britain taking New York in exchange.
Situated between British and French Guiana it has
the Atlantic Ocean on the north, and Brazil on the south.</p>

<p>The colony has a Governor and an executive council
appointed by the Crown, a Legislature elected from the 16
districts. There are District Courts besides a Supreme
Court at Paramaribo appointed by the Crown. The population
is about 107,500, the vast majority colored, besides
negroes and Indians in the forest.</p>

<p><b>Paramaribo</b>, population 37,000, the capital and the only
city of importance, is situated at the mouth of the Surinam
River. Other settlements are on or near the coast, mostly
a little east or west of the Surinam, between the Saramacca
and the Commewyne rivers. Some remarkable cross channels
and the various rivers make boat navigation possible,
at least in the rainy season, all the way from the Maroni
River, the eastern boundary, to the Corentyn on the west.
Like the rivers in British Guiana those here are not navigable
far up, being likewise interrupted by rapids. Back of
the low coast land are savannas with low hills, some rising
to 3000 feet, and impenetrable forests back to the Tumac
Humac Range along the Brazilian frontier. There are a
long and a short dry season with periods of heavy and
lighter rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p><b>Transportation.</b> The only port of commercial importance
is the capital. Internal communication, in addition
to the rivers and channels, is confined to a single railway
extending 109 miles from Paramaribo to Macami on the
Surinam River, a gold shipping point, to which at last accounts
there was a weekly train.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Resources</span></h4>

<p>The natural resources of the country are practically the
same as those of British Guiana.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Agriculture</span></h4>

<p><b>Sugar</b> was a source of great wealth in the days of slavery,
but since this was abolished in 1863 the industry has declined.
Where once there were 400 plantations with an
export of 26,000,000 pounds in the year 1800, there are now
hardly a dozen, scarcity of labor hindering industry. The
soil is rich, and recently there has been some revival, so that
25,000,000 pounds were produced in 1918.</p>

<p><b>Cacao</b> has been cultivated from the beginning, and increasingly
after the abolition of slavery. From 1870 when
1,000,000 pounds were exported the production increased
until 9,000,000 were exported in 1895, since when it has been
declining. Some plantations were ruined by a disease which
attacked the trees. Its effects have been gradually overcome,
and the crop in 1918 was nearly 4,000,000 pounds.</p>

<p><b>Coffee</b> was a large crop in the 18th century, 400 plantations
producing over 12,000,000 pounds annually; later the
production decreased to 500,000 pounds, but in 1918 was over
3,700,000.</p>

<p><b>Balatá</b> for a while was first in importance, but later
diminished.</p>

<p><b>Rice</b> alone shows progress but though 7,500,000 pounds
are raised, some is imported, mostly from British Guiana.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
Some bananas are raised, over 700,000 bunches, a few sent
to Europe. The production of corn was nearly 4,000,000
pounds; of rum over 1,000,000 litres.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Mining</span></h4>

<p><b>Gold</b> has been mined for a long time. After a large
discovery in 1876 there was a rush to the field. For ten
years prior to 1914 gold production declined, but increased
in 1915 when nearly $800,000 in bullion was exported to the
United States. Some European countries have invested,
but few attempts with machinery have been successful.</p>

<p>An American company is said to have spent recently
$1,000,000 in prospecting, in securing land, and in construction
work about 100 miles from Paramaribo. They found
large areas with high grade bauxite, and gold-quartz possibilities.
Some gold was procured from hand worked
placers. Arrangements for placer working on the Marowijne
River have been made with the Dutch and French
authorities. Quicksilver and high grade iron ore are reported
as existing. Great caution should be exercised by
persons disposed to enter the field.</p>

<p>Oil is said to have been located in three places: on the
Surinam River about 90 miles above Paramaribo; on the
Marowijne, 100 miles above Albina; and between the Surinam
River and the railway, 48 miles above the head of deep
water navigation. The second field is said to offer the
best prospects, but there have been no developments.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Other Industries</span></h4>

<p>Dutch Guiana is rich in undeveloped resources. There
are immense untouched forests, grassy savannas capable of
feeding thousands of cattle, undeveloped mineral resources;
but all these await transportation facilities.</p>

<p>East Indian coolies and Javanese have been brought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
the colony as laborers, but it is said that there are not
enough laborers in the busy season and too many the rest
of the time. It is hoped that the region will again prove
attractive for settlement and capital.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">French Guiana</span></h4>

<p>This colony, the smallest of the three, has the Atlantic
on the north and northeast; the Oyapock River on the east
and the Tumac Humac Mountains on the south separate
it from Brazil, the Marowijne River from Dutch Guiana on
the west. The population is about 26,000. The country is
governed by a Commissioner-General, and by a Privy Council;
there is an elected Council of 16 members.</p>

<p>The <b>Capital</b>, Cayenne, with about one half of the population,
at the mouth of the Oyack River, is the only town
of importance. It is well situated on a rocky eminence
with a pleasant view of the harbor. It might be made more
attractive than Georgetown, but the colony has always been
a little behind the others, its use as a penal settlement being
a great disadvantage.</p>

<p><b>Transportation.</b> Steamboat communication is had with
the Safety Islands, 35 miles, with the mouth of the Marowijne
River, 80 miles, with the coast in both directions, and
with the Island of Martinique, which has better shipping
communication. Steamers of the Compagnie Générale Trans-Atlantique
call at Cayenne monthly.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Resources</span></h4>

<p>In physical characteristics this colony is similar to the
others, but its agriculture is of slight importance. The
principal crops are corn, rice, manioc, cacao, coffee, sugar,
indigo, tobacco.</p>

<p><b>Mining</b> and forest products alone are of value in export.
Gold is the chief production, more than $2,000,000 a year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
being generally exported. Most of the 225 claims developed
are being worked by paroled convicts. Those who escape
or are paroled often give serious annoyance to the people in the
other Guianas and are frequently a serious danger. Most
of the country is still covered with dense forest, where probably
much more gold will be found. Phosphate rock is
shipped in small quantities.</p>

<p>The American Company already referred to has headquarters
at St. Laurent, the site of the penal colony, a port 40 miles
up the Marowijne or Maroni River. Here they have big
dredges, aeroplanes, and a wireless station.</p>

<p>Traces of petroleum have been observed southeast of
the Marowijne River, but the indications are not of definite
importance.</p>

<p><b>Forest</b> products are second in importance, rosewood and
its extract, other hard woods, and balatá being exported;
also vegetable oils, cacao, and a few domestic animals.</p>

<p>Railways have been talked of, and it is expected that
one will be constructed towards the interior in the not
remote future.</p>

<p>Aeroplane service is reported as to be installed, both
freight and passenger, from Cayenne to the gold regions
of the interior.</p>

</div>


<p>South of Colombia, fortunate in its Atlantic and Pacific
Coast lines, are three exclusively Pacific countries, unless
we count a rearward communication, so to speak, with the
Atlantic by the Amazon for the first two, or note that the
coast line of the third runs at the south quite to that ocean.
Ecuador, Peru, and Chile, in the order named, now occupy
the remaining Pacific coast line for the several thousand
miles from Colombia to the Horn. In the group of West
Coast States, however, Bolivia may be counted, for though
nearly forty years ago she lost her small strip of coast line,
her communication with the outside world is chiefly by way
of the Pacific, and with these Republics she has characteristics
in common.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Area, Population, Boundary</span></h4>

<p><b>Area.</b> First of the West Coast countries from the north,
Ecuador has an uncertain area on account of boundary
disputes. That with Colombia is lately settled, but not the
one with Peru. With approximately 116,000 square miles
now in her possession, she is usually ranked as next to the
smallest South American Republic, Uruguay. The country
extends from about 2° North Lat. to 6° South.</p>

<p><b>Population.</b> As no official census of Ecuador has ever
been taken, the population is variously stated. A liberal
estimate places the figures at 2,000,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p><b>Boundary.</b> Ecuador’s boundary is uncertain as to the
matter of touching Brazil. However, she has Colombia on
the north and northeast, Peru on the south, and the Pacific
Ocean on the west; most maps give Peru a section on the
southeast as well, shutting Ecuador off from Brazil.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">History</span></h4>

<p>From the remote past, Ecuador has been inhabited by
many tribes of Indians; one of these held sway at Quito
for a thousand years before their subjugation by the Peruvian
Incas. Less than a century later Pizarro arrived with
the Spaniards. Hardly had these conquered Peru, when in
1534, the year following the overthrow of Atahuallpa,
Pizarro dispatched Diego de Almagro and Sebastian de
Benalcazar for the conquest of Ecuador, after which a few
settlements were made. In 1538, Gonzalo Pizarro, brother
of the conqueror, became Governor. In 1540, with Francisco
de Orellana and a large expedition, he went east,
descending through the forests to the Napo River. There
a boat was built in which Orellana with others sailed down
to the Amazon, then on to the Atlantic Ocean, thus first
exploring the greatest river on the globe to which he gave
its present name.</p>

<p>For almost three centuries Ecuador was ruled by Spain,
most of the time under the authority of the Viceroy at
Lima, until in 1822 occurred the decisive battle of Pichincha,
which assured the independence of Ecuador. Soon after,
the country joined New Granada and Venezuela in the
Colombian Federation, but in 1830 set up for itself a separate
republic. Many difficulties, insurrections, and revolutions
have occurred quite up to the present time, 11 changes
of the constitution since 1830; but settled conditions favorable
to the country’s development are now hoped for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Government</span></h4>

<p>Ecuador is a centralized rather than a federal republic,
with the usual three departments. The President, elected
for four years by direct vote, is ineligible for the consecutive
term. Congress consists of a Senate with 32 members and
a Chamber of Deputies with 48. Suffrage is limited to males
over 21 years of age, who can read and write. The Judiciary
consists of a Supreme Court at Quito, and six others
in as many large towns, municipal and civil courts, and
justices of the peace. The Provinces are administered by
Governors named by the Executive, the Departments or Cantons
by <i>jefes politicos</i>, political chiefs, the Parishes by political
lieutenants, and the municipalities by presidents.</p>

<p>The Republic, the capital of which is Quito, has 15 Provinces
and two Territories. Of the former, five are along the
coast, and ten are inland occupying the mountainous section.
The coastal Provinces from the north are Esmeraldas,
Manabí, Guayas, and El Oro. Los Rios, although not touching
the coast, may be counted with them, as occupying a
part of the lowlands, it shares most of their characteristics.
The mountain Provinces, beginning at the north are Carchi,
Imbabura, Pichincha, León, Tungurahua, Chimborazo,
Bolívar, Cañar, Azuay, Loja. Of the two Territories, Oriente
is of course the section at the east, which belongs to the
Amazon Basin, the other is the Galápagos Islands, nearly
600 miles from the main land.</p>

<p>These divisions, with approximate area and population,
their capitals with population and altitude follow:</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Population</span></h4>

<p>The population of Ecuador, approximately 2,000,000, as in
all of these tropical countries is in three principal classes: the
whites, the pure Indians, and the mestizos, those of mixed
blood, here Spanish and Indian. There are also some negroes,
mulattoes, and <i>zambos</i>, the last of negro and Indian blood.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
Those who in these tropical countries are called white in most
cases no doubt have a slight Indian strain, as few women
were among the earliest settlers; but no prejudice exists on
this account. Even when the Indian strain is apparent,
having money and education they enjoy the same social
standing and occupy the highest positions. Those of pure
Spanish blood in most of the countries must be few. The
whites with some of the mestizos form a cultured class
with the manners and customs for the most part of such
society anywhere. The sons of wealthy families are often
educated abroad and many have traveled in Europe. Paris
fashions in dress are followed and continental customs generally.
Courtesy is a marked characteristic, possibly carried
to excess.</p>

<p>The bulk of the population is frankly mestizo and Indian.
The mestizos may be more than one half of the population,
the Indians perhaps one quarter. The Indian population
may be regarded as in three principal classes of widely different
character: those of the coast, of the highlands, and
of the Amazon Basin. The Indians of the coast region were
of various tribes speaking different languages. Superficially
christianized, most of them have become more or less amalgamated
with the whites or with negroes, but in the forests
of Esmeraldas where the Indians, living under similar conditions,
closely resemble those of the Napo district, the
Cayapas retain their language and customs, continuing to
live apart from and to avoid the whites. If not molested
they are hospitable and affable with strangers.</p>

<p>The Indians on the uplands are similar to those on the
Peruvian Plateau, timid and distrustful of foreigners, including
the native whites. They constitute the greater part
of the laboring class and while not slaves in name they are
forced to work for a pittance, and they live as a rule in
extreme poverty and ignorance. Laws for their protection
are generally ignored, and throughout the entire Andine
region they are undoubtedly in a far lower condition than
when the Spaniards invaded the country. The mestizos,
instead of sympathizing with them, generally treat them
worse than do the whites, some of whom recognize the
abuses to which the Indians are subject and desire to improve
their condition. The Indians are strong and vigorous,
especially as to carrying heavy burdens for great distances.
Like many other persons they have an unfortunate weakness
for alcohol. The men wear short loose trousers or drawers
of linen or cotton, a shirt, and most important, a woolen
poncho. They go much with bare feet, but usually have
sandals made of maguey fibre or rawhide. The women
wear a skirt, a cloth covering the body, and a <i>manta</i> or shawl
in which the baby (there usually is one) or some other
object is carried. With a little education, kind, just treatment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
and decent wages, these people would be converted
into a working class of far greater value than at present,
highly serviceable for the development and progress of the
various countries.</p>

<p>Totally dissimilar are the Indians of the Amazonian
forest, of whom there are 46 tribes north of the Marañón,
though the differences among them are ascribed to environment,
rather than to diversity of race. These wear no clothing
or a loin cloth. Many are fairly light colored and in
general they are well formed. Their weapons are bows and
arrows, and the blowpipe used also by the Cayapas. Some
of the tribes are especially savage, as the Jíbaros and the
Huambisa Indians. The former in early times destroyed
the Spanish colonies on the Amazon affluents, while the
latter in 1599 seized the Spanish women after sacking Sevilla
de Oro. Both of these tribes have a considerable
admixture of Spanish blood and are sometimes fair skinned.
They have a reputation for treachery and cruelty, but it is
said that their savage deeds are in retaliation for countless
wrongs previously inflicted by white men, as in the case
of recent atrocities.</p>

<p>The mestizos who live among the whites and intermarry
with them class themselves with them whenever their economic
position permits. Dwelling in remote regions and
in villages among the Indians they tend to revert to the
Indian type. Until they acquire wealth they form the
artisan element, the traders, and the shopkeepers.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Education</span></h4>

<p>Primary education is free and obligatory, but the number
of schools is insufficient, and a large part of the people are
indifferent. Eighty thousand pupils are in attendance, and
4500 more in the secondary schools. There are universities
at Quito, Guayaquil, and Cuenca; six Schools of Arts and
Trades, also Schools of Agriculture, and other institutions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
of a technical or professional character. The machinery of
education is equal to that of its neighbors if not in advance,
but too many professional men are found in all the countries.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Press, Religion, etc.</span></h4>

<p><b>Press.</b> Excellent newspapers exist, notably in Guayaquil
and Quito, influencing civic progress.</p>

<p><b>Religion.</b> In 1904 the Church was placed under the control
of the State, and all religions were made equal before
the law. The women are devoted to the Catholic Church,
as in all the South American countries, but the educated
men are largely materialists. Civil marriage and divorce
were established in 1904.</p>

<p><b>Telegraph.</b> There are several thousand telephones,
mostly in Guayaquil, and about 6000 miles of telegraph wire.
The rates are 10 cents for 10 words, and 5 cents for 10 words
additional. Cable connection is made at Santa Elena on
the Pacific, which has also a wireless station.</p>

<p><b>Money.</b> A condor is a gold coin equal to an English
pound, and to 10 sucres. A sucre is therefore 48.6 cents.
The sucre equals 100 centavos. The sucres and some smaller
coins are silver. The coinage of Peru is similar. It is easy
to remember that a sucre or a Peruvian sol is about half a
dollar, a centavo half a cent.</p>

<p>The <b>Metric System</b> is legal, but the old Spanish weights
and measures, as in Colombia, are much used.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br><span class="small">ECUADOR: PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</span></h3>
</div>


<p>Ecuador, like Peru, has three longitudinal sections: the
Coastal zone, the Inter Andine region, including the mountain
ranges with the plateau or valleys between, and the
Trans Andine, a part of the Amazon basin.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Coastal Zone</span></h4>

<p>The coastal zone in Ecuador is much wider than at the
north or south. We have seen that in Colombia the mountain
ranges are so close to the shore as to leave little space
for cities or agriculture, while in Peru and Chile for the
most part the mountains are visible from the sea. Further,
a good portion of Ecuador’s coastal zone resembles in some
respects the Amazon section, while in Peru the two are
utterly different. Ecuador is the only country favored on
the Pacific side with rivers navigable to any considerable
extent, and the dense tropical vegetation of much of the
coast is in striking contrast to the Peruvian deserts. Remembering
that the equator crosses this country, it is easy
to understand that where there is much rain the lowlands
have a humid tropical climate. The coast curves slightly
outward from the north to Capes San Lorenzo and Santa
Elena, the latter lacking but a few miles of being the most
western point of South America, which distinction falls to
Peru. Near these capes the waters of the cold Antarctic
current turn west towards the Galápagos Islands, the tropical
waters above and the colder current below affecting
the climate of the two sections. Just south of Cape Santa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
Elena begins the Gulf of Guayaquil, the only considerable
arm of the sea indenting the West Coast between Panamá
and the Island of Chiloé in Chile, a stretch of 3000 miles.
Considering the gulf as the broad triangle between Capes
Santa Elena, Ecuador, and Blanco in Peru, with the island,
Puná, as inner limit, the width is 140 miles. The boundary
line of Ecuador, a little north of the Tumbes River, leaves
most of the Gulf line in that country. The Gulf penetrates
east and slightly north about 100 miles to the Guayas River
or estuary. Along the southern shore are occasional estuaries
with small river openings and mangrove swamps.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Mountain Section</span></h4>

<p>The central mountainous region belongs of course to the
great chain of the Andes. As in the countries previously
studied, this section of Ecuador differs greatly from the
lowlands. Happily the formation is simpler than in Colombia.
Extending from a rather confused mass near the
boundary of Peru to another jumble of peaks at the Colombian
border, a distance of 300 miles, are two parallel ranges,
the East and the West Cordillera, from 20 to 30 miles apart.
The plateau region between, which is higher at the north,
is separated by two lower transverse ridges called <i>páramos</i>
into three shallow basins or plains: those of Quito, Ambato,
and Cuenca; the first basin with an altitude of 9500 feet,
the second, 8500 feet, the third, 7800 feet. Some of the water
from these flows into the Pacific and some into the Atlantic.
East and west are the two rows of mountains in a remarkably
symmetrical arrangement, sometimes exactly opposite
each other. Nowhere else in the world are there two such
rows of giants or such a collection of snow crowned volcanoes.
Of the 22 great peaks, several are active volcanoes
and more are extinct. The main range or Cordillera Real
is the eastern, with the larger number of lofty peaks; but
the highest of all is in the West Cordillera, Chimborazo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
altitude 20,498 feet. This mountain, first ascended by
Edward Whymper, a celebrated English climber, in 1880,
was formerly supposed by many to be the loftiest of the
Andes; but farther south at least a dozen peaks are higher,
probably two or three times as many.</p>

<p>The volcanic section, as we have seen, extends into
Colombia; but not into Peru. Especially noteworthy are
Cotopaxi of the East Cordillera, the highest active volcano
in the world, 19,613 feet, and Pichincha, the only one historically
eruptive in the West Cordillera. The latter, situated
very near Quito, has been the source of highly destructive
eruptions. Sangay, east of the Ambato Basin, the
most southern and among the most active on the globe, does
little harm as no settlements are near. The Cuenca Basin,
with no erupting volcanoes, contains volcanic material. In
the most southern province, Loja, no such signs appear, nor
in Peru for some degrees south.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Oriente</span></h4>

<p>The country of the Oriente, with no llanos, is similar
to forested southeastern Colombia. The mountains slope
down into the forests, which cover their lower eastern declivities
and the plain beyond. This inclines toward the
region of the Amazon, with slight undulations well away
from the mountains; but the nearer sections are broken by
lateral spurs from the main chain, or by low isolated ranges
separating the basins of the larger Amazon affluents.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Rivers, Amazon Tributaries</span></h4>

<p>North of the <i>nudo</i> or knot in the Loja province, spurs and
ravines lead off from the high mountain range. Here swift
flowing streams descend in a region called wild and savage.
Those rising farthest north reach the Amazon at a more
eastern point than the streams rising nearer, at the south;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
so the mention of the principal rivers of the eastern slope
will begin with the most southern and western tributary.
It may be remembered that the Amazon is formed by the
union of the Marañón and the Ucayali Rivers, both flowing
northwest in Peru, the former, the one nearer the Pacific
coast. Above 6° S. Lat. the Marañón turns sharply east,
flowing with northerly and southerly deviations, receiving
in its course many tributaries before and after breaking
through the East Cordillera of Peru at the Pongo de Manseriche.
Here the waters of the previously broad river pass
through an extraordinary chasm 3 miles long and 100 feet
wide. The walls are not 2000 feet high as often stated; in
one or two places they may rise 40 feet perpendicularly, but
usually they are wooded slopes, rising in a single locality
perhaps 2000 feet.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The principal rivers flowing from
Ecuador into the Marañón or Amazon are the Chinchipe,
Santiago, Morona, Pastaza, Tigre, Nanay, and Napo. These
with the streams from Colombia drain the northwest part
of the Amazon Basin and are capable of adding much to the
economic value of the region. The few white settlements
existing are as nothing in this vast wilderness.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> See Geographical Journal, October, 1920</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Chinchipe River</b> rises in southern Loja and after
receiving many tributaries flows into the Marañón a little
below where that river runs northeast. The lower part of
the Chinchipe is navigable.</p>

<p><b>The Santiago River</b> rises near the town of Loja between
the two Cordilleras. Several of its important tributaries
rise in Loja, or in the Cuenca basin farther north. One of
these, the Pauta, has a branch rising only 30 miles from the
Gulf of Guayaquil, a source nearer the Pacific than that of
any other river flowing into the Atlantic unless it be in the
very south of Chile. The Santiago enters the Marañón a
little above the rapids of the Pongo Manseriche. At the
mouth of the stream was once a town, Santiago, which like
Borja below the Pongo was destroyed by savages.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>
<p><b>The Morona River.</b> Two of the many tributaries of the
Morona rise in the East Cordillera at heights above 13,000
and 14,000 feet north of the Apuay knot. At high water
the Morona is navigable for 300 miles, at low water for 200,
for steamers drawing from 2 to 4 feet, and also two of its
tributaries; but due to the tortuous course of the river
the 300 miles equals but 120 in a straight line. Earlier many
flourishing missions existed in this section, but in the last
century the Huambisa Indians inhabiting the upper reaches
of the Santiago and the Morona almost exterminated the
Indians who had been civilized. So recently as February,
1913, members of the same tribe massacred the soldiers of
a Peruvian outpost. This, notwithstanding, was later re-established
by Peru.</p>

<p><b>The Pastaza River</b>, rising in the basin of Riobamba at
a height of nearly 15,000 feet, flows through a little known
district receiving many tributaries. The lower part is
navigable for steamers at high water to the Huasaga branch,
120 miles, and 200 miles farther by canoe. This fluvial
system drains the basins of Latacunga, Ambato, and Riobamba,
the snows of Chimborazo, Cotopaxi, and other peaks
contributing to its waters. A spot where the unified river
at an altitude of about 6000 feet in one leap makes a splendid
fall of 190 feet is said to be one of the most picturesque
scenes in the Andes.</p>

<p><b>The River Tigre</b> belongs to the region of the plains,
though some of its affluents rise in the East Cordillera.
Although in volume not to be compared to the Pastaza or
the Napo it is quite as important, being navigable for steamers
of 4 to 8 feet draught at high water for over 400 miles,
and in low water for steamers drawing 2 to 4 feet; 100 miles
more on the Corriente branch and 40 on the Pucasuro, with
an additional 1260 miles by canoe on its various tributaries.
The region traversed is rich in natural products and with
over 100 tributaries the river deserves remembrance. It
enters the Marañón 40 miles above the Ucayali.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p><b>The Nanay</b>, a much smaller plains river with a slow current,
yet with a high bank and a healthful climate, may be
ascended for 105 miles and has some importance.</p>

<p><b>The Napo River</b>, formerly part of the boundary line between
Colombia and Ecuador but now given over to Ecuador,
has sources among the Ecuadorian volcanoes, Cotopaxi,
Antisana, and others. At first the descent is rapid.
At the foot of the Cordillera 100 miles from the source, and
but 1500 feet above the sea, canoe navigation begins at the
village of Napo. Sixty miles below, the Coca River comes
in. This section includes the Napo missions, a beautiful
region long known and visited by botanists and geologists.
Here ends the influence of the Roman Church and the land
of the <i>salvajes</i> or <i>infieles</i> begins. It was down the Coca valley
that Gonzales Pizarro and Orellana came in 1540. From this
point the Napo runs in forested plains, receiving many more
tributaries, the large Aguarico, and the Curaray. The Napo
is called navigable in high water for steamers from the
Amazon about 200 miles up to the Curaray, some say to the
Aguarico, 560 miles, and little less at low water. At one
point the Napo is but 50 or 60 miles from the Putumayo,
with which communication by canoe is possible, and often
made. The route from the Putumayo to Iquitos by way of
the Napo is much shorter for the rubber gatherers, as the
Napo flows into the Amazon not far below that city, while
the Putumayo enters it several hundred miles farther down.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Rivers of the Coast</span></h4>

<p>The Rivers of the Coast are with one exception of comparatively
slight importance.</p>

<p><b>The Santiago River</b> (not to be confounded with the
Amazon tributary of that name), a short distance from the
Colombian border, is formed by several large streams, and
has many tributaries, receiving its waters from high in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
West Cordillera. Some of the lower reaches are navigable
for canoes and steam launches.</p>

<p><b>The Esmeraldas River</b>, second in importance to the
Guayas, rises a few miles north of Quito in the high plateau
region, from which, breaking through the West Cordillera,
it descends to the coast. While not navigable for steamers
because of the swift current, it may be ascended by canoes
for more than 60 miles. With a great number of tributaries
it drains a very large mountain area as well as a slightly
smaller region of lowland.</p>

<p>The <b>Guayas</b> is undoubtedly the most important river
system on the entire west coast, and the only one admitting
much navigation. It drains and irrigates a large region,
14,000 square miles, between the great Andes and the low
coastal hills. This section has been called the most fertile
belt of tropical America. Below the Island of Puná, the
river is lost in the Gulf; above, it has much the character
of an estuary up to the city of Guayaquil, 33 miles, where
it has a width of more than a mile. Not far above the city,
the river loses its name at the confluence of the Daule and
Bodegas. These two have other names, as do their tributaries
also. The principal branches of the Bodegas, which
is known also as the Babahoyo, are the Yaguachi or Chimbo,
the Vinces or Quevado, and the Calamara or Sapotal; the
Daule farther west, also called the Balzar, is about 130
miles long, not counting its windings. In its upper part it
receives the Grande and Peripe Rivers, and lower down a
number of streams and <i>esteros</i> or canals.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Climate</span></h4>

<p>The climate of the several sections, as in Colombia and
Venezuela, varies chiefly on account of the altitude, though
in places affected also by other causes obvious or hidden.
The coastal region is warm with a mean temperature of
82.4°, but with variation in humidity and rainfall. South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
of the equator the coast is arid with little rain, except in the
vicinity of the Gulf of Guayaquil; but farther north in the
Province of Esmeraldas there is rain and luxuriant vegetation,
as along the Colombian littoral. Towards the mountains,
the climate though warmer is agreeable in the dry
season.</p>

<p>The mountains which approach the shore of the Gulf of
Guayaquil condense the moisture of the trade winds from
the east, causing plenty of rain, sometimes too much; the
humidity is excessive. Guayaquil, average temperature 80°,
has been notoriously unhealthful. The condition, however,
was due more to lack of sanitation than to the climate itself.
We know of the wonderful change at Panamá; but at Guayaquil,
partly no doubt because of several revolutions and
financial difficulties, yellow fever and other diseases have
long been prevalent. Happily yellow fever was eradicated
under the supervision of General Gorgas, but bubonica and
small pox may still exist. Recently contracts have been
placed for sanitation, sewers, paving, and other improvements,
and something is already accomplished.</p>

<p>In some sections there are two rainy and two dry seasons
a year, in others it is liable to rain at any time. At
Guayaquil the rainy season is from December to April inclusive,
or longer, the remainder of the year being dry. In
Ecuador the dry season though the cooler is called <i>verano</i> or
summer, while the warmer rainy months are called <i>invierno</i> or
winter.</p>

<p>The climate of the Ecuadorian Highlands may be called
healthful, with varying temperatures according to the altitude
and exposure to the wind. On the east side of the
mountains the precipitation is greater than on the west
side, as along the entire Cordilleras, except in southern Chile.
The snow line varies from 14,000 feet to 15,650 and more,
the difference depending chiefly upon the amount of precipitation
in the various localities. As the dwellings in
these regions have no artificial heat they are uncomfortable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
much of the time for Americans, accustomed to warm
houses. A similar condition prevails in all the cooler sections
of South America, the natives being indifferent to a
temperature that would be discomfort to most of us. When
it is really too cold for them they put on overcoats, furs,
ponchos, and even hats in the house. In general in the
Inter-Andine region between 6000 and 11,000 feet altitude
the annual temperature is from 64° to 68° with frequent
variations. At any season rain in the afternoon is common,
and in the summer high winds make the <i>paramos</i> often dangerous.
The high death rate among the working people and
Indians is due more to bad living conditions than to the climate.
Leprosy is fairly common; there is a good deal of
malaria and typhoid fever. Tuberculosis is unknown but
catarrhal complaints are prevalent. Persons coming up from
the lowlands frequently suffer from mountain sickness, <i>soroche</i>,
though less than where the railroads reach a higher elevation.</p>

<p>In the Trans-Andine section the lower region has two
wet and two dry seasons, the most rain being from the end
of February to the middle of June, another period is from
the middle of October to January; but there is rain in every
month. On the mountain slopes the dry season is from
November to April.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br><span class="small">ECUADOR: CAPITAL, PROVINCES, CHIEF CITIES</span></h3>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Capital</span></h4>

<p><b>Quito</b>, capital of Ecuador, population 100,000, altitude
9348 feet, has a world wide reputation as the city on or
under the equator. It is within a quarter of a degree. Interesting
historically and on account of its unusual and
beautiful location, it is backward in many ways. There are
fine Government buildings and churches, hotels said to be
fair, cultured people, many Indians, recently a tramway.
Lately sewers and paving have been authorized. The climate
is considered good with a temperature of from 40° to
70°; a half day’s journey will bring one to a sultry valley
with tropical vegetation; hence every kind of fruit and
vegetable is in the market.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Provinces</span></h4>

<p><b>Esmeraldas</b>, the most northern of the coastal Provinces
of Ecuador, thus bordering on Colombia, has at the east
Carchi, Imbabura, and Pichincha. Although its natural
riches have hitherto received less attention than they deserve,
it has excellent prospects for the future. The region
is well watered and the vegetation rich. Near the boundary,
the large bay, Ancon de Sardinas, with its estuaries is
navigable for small steamers and launches. Now difficult of
access for large vessels on account of shoals and sand banks
it might with dredging afford them safe anchorage.</p>

<p>Farther south at the mouth of the Esmeraldas River,
Esmeraldas, capital of the Province, population about 6000,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
is a port of call for some of the steamers from Panamá to
Guayaquil. A sand bar at the mouth of the river compels
them to anchor well outside. Besides coast settlements,
there are villages at the junction of the affluents with the
larger streams, and occasional <i>haciendas</i> along the banks. The
Province extends far back into the Andean foothills.</p>

<p><b>Manabí</b> on the south is more hilly than Esmeraldas, but
has smaller rivers and less humidity and rain. Part of the
long stretch of sea coast is rather dry. The lowland Province
of Guayas at the south runs up also on the east with
Pichincha farther north. The Bay of Caráquez, on which
is a port of the same name, with dredging would become an
excellent harbor. A fertile country lies at the back. Just
north of Cape San Lorenzo is the Bay of Manta; the city
at the south end, Manta, is the chief port of the Province.</p>

<p>Portoviejo, the capital, a city of some 10,000, is 15 miles
up the Portoviejo River. At the foot of a hill 1500 feet
high is Montecristi, a village, the name of which is familiar
to those conversant with the Panamá hat industry; Jipijapa,
of like reputation, is near. When a hat purchased at Paita
was called by a dealer a Montecristi, it was a high but well
merited compliment. Ivory nuts, rubber, and agriculture
are other industries.</p>

<p><b>Guayas</b>, the largest of all the Provinces, borders on the
Pacific south of Manabí, as well as on the Gulf of Guayaquil.
El Oro is at the south; Azuay, Cañar, and Los Rios are east.
The Province includes the most western point of Ecuador,
Santa Elena, with the bay at the north; Ballenita on this
bay, port of the town Santa Elena, is the landing place of
the West Coast cables. In this vicinity petroleum wells
have been attempted on a small scale. More important industries
at present are the agricultural, pastoral, and forestal.
Panamá hats are made and fishing is important. Plantations
of cacao, coffee, and sugar cane, and many varieties
of fruit trees are found along the rivers, and some cattle
are raised. The Island Puná is included in the Province.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
It is well wooded; timber and cattle raising are the chief
industries of the 200 inhabitants.</p>

<p>Guayaquil, the capital of the Province, is the chief commercial
city of the Republic.</p>

<p><b>Los Rios</b>, north and east of Guayas, and west of Bolívar,
partakes of the characteristics of the former; a lowland
region with fertile cacao lands, many rivers, and several
towns busy with interior commerce. Cattle breeding, and
timber extraction are important.</p>

<p><b>El Oro</b>, the most southern of the coastal provinces, thus
bordering on Tumbes, Peru, with Loja also on the south and
east, and Azuay northeast, extends into the sierra region,
as here the range in Ecuador comes nearest to the Pacific;
one peak is over 13,000 feet high. Along the shore are mangrove
swamps and salt plains.</p>

<p>Machala, the capital, a little farther back, is near one of
the famous cacao sections. Along the many streams and
<i>esteros</i> back of the mangrove swamps are sabanas 1-3 miles
wide, excellent for cattle; then come the cultivated lands, sandy
soil overlaid by rich earth where cacao grows wild, and where
other plants like bananas and coffee flourish. The lower slopes
of the Cordillera up to 3300 feet are also favorable to tropical
culture. Fisheries are important and in the Zaruma <i>Hoya</i> or
Basin is gold mining.</p>

<p><b>Loja</b> on the east, and extending farther south, has Peru
on both south and west, the precise boundary line still uncertain;
the Oriente is on the east. Traversed by the Cordillera
Real, it has hot and cold regions, with pleasing towns
and bleak spots. The capital, Loja, altitude 7300 feet, is
quite a city with 14,000 population.</p>

<p><b>The Andean Provinces</b> farther north are largely similar
to each other in production and characteristics.</p>

<p><b>Azuay</b>, where there are gold washings and hat making,
has the ordinary agriculture and cattle raising of the highlands.</p>

<p>The important town of Cuenca, altitude 8465 feet, is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
capital, with a population of 40,000, the third city in Ecuador.
Seventy miles southeast of Guayaquil, it is south of the
present railway system, carrying on its traffic with the outside
world over mountain ranges by means of bridle paths
only. It has a few factories for the making of sugar, woolen
goods, pottery, hats, and cheese.</p>

<p><b>Cañar</b> follows, between Guayas west and Oriente east.
It includes the great knot of Azuay and its once famous
quicksilver mines, now apparently exhausted. From these,
the chief town, Azogues, near by, population 9000, took its
name.</p>

<p><b>Chimborazo</b>, as might be supposed, contains Ecuador’s
greatest mountain of that name. The Province is followed
at the north by Tungurahua, Leon, Pichincha, Imbabura, and
Carchi, all quite similar, with their rows of mountains, their
cattle, textile industries, growing of cereals, and in the valleys,
sugar cane and cotton.</p>

<p>Tulcán in Carchi, and Ibarra in Imbabura are mountain
towns, which have some commercial intercourse along the
plateau with Pasto, Colombia; with this city they will some
day have rail connection.</p>

<p><b>Bolívar</b>, the smallest Province, is off the line, like Los
Rios, being between that Province and Chimborazo. It has
the mountainous character and resources of the latter.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Territories</span></h4>

<p>The <b>Galápagos Islands</b>, though of little importance at
present, may become valuable as a commercial focus or as
a coaling station, since the group lies almost in the path
of vessels from the Panama Canal to Australia. Thirteen
in number, the Islands on or near the equator have an area
of nearly 3000 miles. Except Chaves Island they are privately
owned. The inhabitants are few: a small colony on
Charles or Santa Maria Island, others on Chatham or San
Cristóbal, and on Albemarle. On Chatham is a sugar plantation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
with a factory for refining sugar and distilling alcohol.
Three million pounds of sugar are produced, and if there
were a market 40,000 gallons of alcohol might be, instead
of the 3500 at present. A coffee plantation of 320,000 trees
yields about 300,000 pounds of coffee yearly. Water has
been piped five miles and a Decauville railway built. Henequen
plants have been set out to furnish material for the
needed bags and twine. The cattle industry and fishing
are of importance; codfish and lobsters are abundant.</p>

<p>The Islands are especially distinguished for the giant
tortoises which are said to live 500 years and sometimes
weigh 600 pounds. None such are on the main land. They
yield excellent oil, have good flesh and eggs, but are diminishing
in numbers and should receive protection. A proposition
to lease the Islands to the United States Government
in 1911 was rejected by Ecuador.</p>

<p>The <b>Oriente</b> embraces a large forest region, which contains
the varieties of trees and other conditions such as are
found in the forests of Peru and Colombia; but up to this
time there has been little exploitation of its resources. Quite
recently the possibilities of petroleum development have
been investigated. A concession for exploration and for
the drilling of wells in an area of nearly 10,000 square miles
has been granted to the Leonard Exploration Company,
American.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br><span class="small">ECUADOR: PORTS AND INTERIOR
TRANSPORTATION</span></h3>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Ports</span></h4>

<p><b>Guayaquil.</b> The most important and frequently visited
place in Ecuador is the coast city of Guayaquil, the chief
port of entry through which communication is had with
most of the interior districts. The entrance to the port
from the Gulf is by way of the Jambeli Channel south of
the island, Puná, on which the quarantine station is located,
and where a pilot is taken for the 30 mile journey up the
river. Guayaquil is accessible by ordinary ocean steamers
drawing no more than 22 feet of water. Larger vessels may
anchor at Puná and there transfer passengers or cargo to
boats or lighters. It is now proposed to dredge the river
as far as Guayaquil. Ships do not come to the docks, which
for a mile and a half line the water front of Guayaquil. As
in general along the entire coast, goods are transferred to
lighters and passengers to rowboats or launches in order to
reach the city.</p>

<p>Founded in 1535, Santiago de Guayaquil has suffered
many calamities: sacked by buccaneers, more or less destroyed
by conflagrations, and shaken by earthquakes. From
the water the town has a pleasing appearance, which is constantly
improving. The buildings of wood and plaster, which
appear quite massive, present the usual variety; many contain
first class shops where almost everything is purchasable.
The water supply, which is to be largely increased,
coming from the Cordillera, 53 miles, passes under the river
to a reservoir on the northern hills. There are electric lights
and tramways, cable communication by telegraph from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
Santa Elena, also wireless, several manufacturing plants
for local needs, such as gas, ice, chocolate, etc., and a shipyard
where vessels are built or repaired. The tide here is
swift and strong (8 knots an hour), both up and down, so
that all boats take advantage of it in going either way; the
flat boats manned by natives bring down provisions, vegetables,
and fruit, or go below to fish, without exertion on
their part, and with little if any returning. The city is on
a low plain with a salt estuary at the back. This could
easily be made into an excellent quiet harbor, with docks
approachable by steamers, an advantage which would doubtless
expedite the gradual increase of commerce.</p>

<p><b>Minor Ports</b> are Esmeraldas, Bahia, Manta, Cayo,
Machalilla, Manglar Alto, Ballenita.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Railways</span></h4>

<p><b>Guayaquil-Quito Railway.</b> The American built railway
to Quito, 290 miles long, opened in June, 1908, begins on
the opposite side of the river at a place called Durán, to
which passengers are ferried by the company. Here are
the railway offices, repair shops, and warehouses. The railway
traverses a fine country where sugar cane, coffee,
cacao, bananas, and plantains are cultivated, to Bucay, nearly
1000 feet above the sea, at the foot of the Cordillera, 57
miles from Durán. A steep climb here begins with at times
a 4¹⁄₂ per cent grade. Above Huigra at 4000 feet, where the
upland Indian in poncho appears, is a section where land-slides
and washouts are common. Here is a famous switchback
where the train backs up the face of a precipice on a
ledge cut in the rock. At the Alausi Loop, besides a fine
view of a splendid river gorge, the system of terrace cultivation
is well seen, every available foot being thus employed
up to 12,000 feet.</p>

<p>There is a slight descent to Riobamba, altitude 9200,
where the night is spent. On this healthful plateau wheat is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
cultivated, in increasing quantity since the coming of the
railway. Beyond Riobamba, which is noted for its market,
made picturesque by hundreds of Indians from the surrounding
country, the highest point of the railway is
reached, the Chimborazo Pass, 11,841 feet. A descent follows
to Ambato, altitude 8550 feet. The climate is more
equable than most of the other basins enjoy, and the “Fair”
held here is the most famous in Ecuador. In the Latacunga
Valley are good pasture lands with cattle, and irrigated
fields where fruits and vegetables of the temperate
zone are raised. At a height almost equal to that of the
Chimborazo Pass, the road crosses the base of Cotopaxi,
from whose crest the smoke is ever curling. The fertile
valley of Machachi beyond, with its rows on right and left
of famous volcanoes, often covered with green up to the
eternal snows, presents a picture unique in all the world.
The Chillo Valley near, contains cotton and woolen mills
run by water power, manufacturing cheap cloth for the use
of the natives. Quito has for some time been the terminus
of the railway. Owing to engineering difficulties its cost
was so great that it has not been a paying proposition; with
settled conditions good returns are hoped for. Wood has
been used as fuel but a change to oil is expected.</p>

<p><b>Additional railways</b> are planned, and construction work
is going on at several points. The line is being prolonged
from Quito to Ibarra, 105 miles, another link in the Pan
American chain. Several other roads are expected to climb
to Quito from the coast. The first of these to be completed
is the Esmeraldas Railway from the port San Lorenzo 125
miles to Ibarra. Construction is well advanced.</p>

<p>Another railroad of 186 miles planned from Bahia de
Caráquez is now operated to Chone, 20 miles only. Its completion
may follow that of Esmeraldas. One more is talked
of from Ancon de Sardinas, all to extend to Quito. To the
east connection is planned with the Amazon Basin by means
of a railway from Ambato to San Antonio on the Curaray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
River, from which steam navigation would be made by the
Curaray and the Napo to the Amazon. From Ambato 20
miles have been constructed. From Sibambe, a little below
Alausi, a railway is begun to Cuenca, 125 miles. A railway
94 miles long from Guayaquil to Santa Elena is half finished,
1921. The Government of Ecuador is said to have authorized
a concession for the construction of a railway from
Puerto Bolívar on the Pacific to Borja, just below the Pongo
de Manseriche on the Marañón.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Other Means of Communication</span></h4>

<p>Aside from the few railways, water ways and mule trails
are the means of communication. The rivers, and the estuaries,
tide water channels, are of great importance, even streams
practicable only for canoes. On the Ecuador littoral 600 miles
altogether are deemed navigable, these at present of greater
use than the Amazon tributaries, which in the future will have
a development of assured value.</p>

<p>On the water ways of the Pacific system the steamboat,
the flat boat or <i>chata</i>, the raft, and the canoe, all have their
place. Steamboats of from 25 to 125 tons serve the Guayas
River System above Guayaquil, this including nearly a dozen
streams or estuaries, in winter penetrating to the foot of the
Cordilleras. If the natural water ways were properly developed
and a few artificial canals were opened, a much larger
field of the richest territory would be accessible. The <i>chatas</i>,
boats without sails carrying from 4 to 50 tons, are of lighter
draught, the rafts too are important. Made of bamboo and
<i>balsa</i> wood they are very light, a single log 40 feet long being
able to support 2 tons. Rafts of 20 or 30 logs, in part roofed
over, carry the entire family as well as heavy freight. Thanks
to the strong tide on the rivers they float down stream very
rapidly, returning with a load up stream at turn of tide, more
slowly, but without additional propulsion, far above Guayaquil.
In this way 48 miles a day may be covered. Canoes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
of course have the same advantage and steamboats also, these
being often delayed at Puná or Guayaquil to have the benefit
of the tide which runs 8 miles an hour. The canoes, which are
able to carry from 500 to 50,000 pounds of freight, bring from
remote places valuable cargoes of cacao or other stuff and
return laden with supplies. Few roads or trails exist in this
section, but there are some, available in the dry season, especially
in the better populated districts of Guayas. A trail
through the jungle called a <i>trocha</i>, made with axe and machete,
is soon overgrown again.</p>

<p>In the Andine section there is one good cart road leading
from Quito 115 miles south. The trails to the east are five in
number; the most frequented, the one from the Pichincha
Province (Quito) to the <i>pueblos</i> or villages of the Napo (a
high road is now being constructed), one from Tungurahua
farther south through Baños to Canelas; one from Chimborazo
to Macas; one from Azuay to Gualaquiza; one from
Loja to Zumba and Chita, and on to Jaen in Peru.</p>

<p>Between the plateau region and the coast, at the north,
practically no communication exists, but farther down there
are a number of trails. Thus there are roads to Latacunga
and Ambato from the lower valleys west, several extend
to points above from Babahoya or Bodegas, the capital of
Los Rios and the chief port of the interior on the river
which also enjoys the two names. Bodegas is 36 miles up
from Guayaquil and is reached by a strong tide so that
river steamers come up on the flood in 8 hours and even
go higher in winter when the rivers are full. It is from
Bodegas that interior traffic begins to points not easily
accessible from the railway.</p>

<p>From Naranjal and Machala, coastal towns of El Oro at
the extreme south, roads lead to Cuenca and other interior
towns; other roads farther south go to Loja, and to Tumbes
in Peru. All of these roads are merely mule or bridle trails,
no wagon roads existing. In the Andine region there are
naturally additional trails from one point to another, many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
reaching altitudes of 13,000 or 14,000 feet, crossing chasms
or rivers on swinging bridges three feet wide, with no more
guard than a single wire if any, and passing along slippery
dangerous slopes, where the meeting of a loaded mule train
may well excite terror; a rock wall on one side and a precipice
on the other, often leaving small space for passage.
Scenes of beauty may repay some persons for the discomforts
and risks endured, but not the average tourist, nor
will sufficient business reward the commercial traveler.</p>

<p>The Leonard Exploration Company is to make caminos
and later cart roads into the Oriente, where its oil wells may
be located.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br><span class="small">ECUADOR: RESOURCES AND INDUSTRIES</span></h3>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Agriculture</span></h4>

<p>The chief productions, industries, and exports of Ecuador
are, as might be expected, agricultural or forestal in character.</p>

<p><b>Cacao.</b> The cultivation of cacao is by far the most
important industry of Ecuador, the amount exported in
1910 having nearly ten times the value of any other commodity.
The shrub grows wild in many tracts where it is
necessary merely to cut out other growth, leaving such tall
trees as may be desirable to shade the cacao shrubs. It
remains only to weed the land once a year, to give occasional
prunings, and to harvest the fruit. Besides these
natural and irregular plantations many have been prepared
by clearing a suitable tract except for the required shade
trees. In holes two or three yards apart the fresh cacao
seeds are sowed; they sprout and grow rapidly. The plants
must be sheltered from the sun, maize or yucca serving this
purpose for two years, or if the banana plant is used it will
suffice for 6 or 7 years till the cacao comes into bearing.
By this time other shade trees which may have been planted
will be large enough to serve, and the banana plants are
cut down. The plantation will then last indefinitely, for
when the old trees die at the age of 60 or 80 years a new
growth will have appeared to continue the work. The principal
harvest is in March and April, but the fruit may be
gathered during the entire year. The pod containing the
seeds is left on the ground a day or two after cutting, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
the seeds are taken out and put in the sweating house for
fermentation, which gives a superior color, flavor, and
aroma. Drying follows. The cacao is rich in fats, albuminoids,
caffeine, and theobromine. In preparation for
cocoa the fat is removed and used for cocoa butter; it is
retained for chocolate, which is therefore richer than cocoa
and for many persons is less digestible. A large area is now
under cultivation but more land is available. The best plantations
are at an altitude of 650-2600 feet. Twelve per cent
is an ordinary return on an investment, and at 1918 prices
from 15 to 25 per cent. It is the safest and easiest crop
of the country, and foreign investors have engaged in the
industry. The districts south of Guayaquil yield especially
fine crops, though cacao flourishes on any of the hot humid
lowlands. With more scientific culture the quality might
probably be improved, as it is said to be hardly equal to the
best raised elsewhere.</p>

<p><b>Other products</b> are cotton, sugar, maize, tobacco, coffee,
tagua, rice, yucca (known also as cassava and mandioca),
bananas, indigo, rubber, quinine, bread fruit, etc., all growing
up to 3000 feet and some much higher, but of these tagua,
rubber, 1,000,000 pounds, and coffee, crop 7,000,000 pounds,
in the order named, are the only important exports.</p>

<p><b>Sugar cane</b> grows rapidly and many sections are suited
to it, as also to rice, but not enough of either is produced
to supply the home market, though the sugar output
amounts to 16,000,000 pounds and much cane is turned into
<i>aguardiente</i> or rum. Suitable land is open in Esmeraldas and
Manabí. In the Guayas Valley large possibilities exist for extending
the rice industry.</p>

<p><b>Tobacco</b> is cultivated in low lying river lands and plains;
that of the Daule River with culture might rival the Havana;
that of Esmeraldas is noted for its agreeable aroma.</p>

<p>For the poor people along the shore the <b>plantain</b> is the
staff of life, being eaten green, half ripe or ripe, cooked or
raw. For the Indians above, maize is the staple article of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
food, chiefly eaten dry and toasted, and much used by others
as a green vegetable.</p>

<p><b>Coffee</b>, which grows up to 5000 feet, is raised for export
on the large plantations in the lower zone. It is said to
be of quality superior to the Brazilian and brings a high
price. Tropical fruits abound such as pomegranates, <i>paltas</i>,
<i>chirimoias</i>, <i>granadillas</i>, oranges, grape-fruit, etc., some of which
are exported to Peru and elsewhere.</p>

<p>On the higher lands wheat and barley are cultivated, also
maize in sheltered places as well as in the lowlands. Potatoes
thrive in the sierra, and other temperate zone fruits and vegetables.
Alfalfa is extensively raised wherever possible as
fodder for traffic animals.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Forestry</span></h4>

<p><b>Tagua</b> and <b>rubber</b> are more forest than cultivated products,
though a few plantations of each have been set out. In
Western Ecuador rubber is produced by the <i>caucho</i> tree, and
in consequence of the destruction of these by cutting down,
they are now to be found in remote districts only. The rubber
of the finer class, the <i>hevea</i>, is obtained from the Amazon
Basin only. The forests contain many valuable plants and
trees of which little use is made save by the Indians for their
huts and for other necessities.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Stock Raising and Fisheries</span></h4>

<p>The <b>cattle</b> industry is in a backward state, and the wool
of the highland sheep is poor. It is used locally, a little exported;
also hides. The quality of these is called very good.
Goat and alligator skins are also exported. The llama,
so much employed as a beast of burden farther south, is
little used in Ecuador, in one or two Provinces only. A
few horses and mules are exported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>A great variety of <b>fish</b> is found along the coast including
oysters and lobsters. The industry is important, fish forming
a material part of the food supply for this region. Some
pearls are found near the island La Plata, off the coast of
Manabí; the industry near Manta was suspended on account
of the ferocious sharks which infest these waters.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Mining</span></h4>

<p>Ecuador, so far as is known, is the poorest in minerals
of any of the Pacific Coast countries. Copper, iron, lead,
quicksilver and platinum exist, but apparently not in commercial
quantities. In the province of Loja are copper
deposits, but limited operation has been unsuccessful.</p>

<p><b>Petroleum</b> has better prospects. Bituminous seams with
fair quantities of oil have been located in the north, but more
favorable developments would naturally be expected in the
same line with the rich oil fields of Peru. In El Oro near
the town of Santa Rosa there is said to be an oil field
with good prospects, but the principal deposits so far discovered
are more nearly in line with the Zorritos and
Lobitos districts. The field, extending about 6 miles north
and south and 20 miles inland, is close to the coast, 90 miles
west of Guayaquil, in desert country near the port of Santa
Elena and 750 miles from Panamá. A small oil fountain
with considerable gas indicates that deep drilling would
bring results. The 25,000 barrels now secured annually are
obtained by digging small holes down 50 feet to a layer
of impermeable sandstone which is impregnated with oil.
The life of these wells is from 3 months to 3 years. A
deep well bored by an Anglo-French Company contains oil
of a high quality. There is connection with Guayaquil by a
fairly good automobile road and by telephone and telegraph.
A railway to Santa Elena and Ballenita is in construction.
Petroleum claims have recently been denounced
in the Canton of Quito, Province of Pichincha. Indications<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
of petroleum in the Oriente have been sufficient to
warrant the Leonard Exploration Company in securing a
concession of nearly 10,000 square miles east of the Andes
from Tulcán to Riobamba in which to explore and drill
for oil.</p>

<p><b>Gold.</b> Of metals, gold mines only have up to the present
been profitably worked; those of Zaruma in Southern Ecuador
have long been known and operated. In 1549 the towns
Zaruma and Zamora were founded and mining was established.
Other discoveries followed attended by a gold mining
rush from Peru; but owing to the greed of the Governor
of Macas, residing at Sevilla, the Jívaros Indians rebelled,
destroyed several towns, and murdered many inhabitants,
so that in later times the mining has been limited
to the placers of Esmeraldas and the lodes of Zaruma. In
recent years there have been examinations and working at
Zaruma with some mismanagement, but the values are
considered proved and shipments have been regularly made,
to the extent of $250,000 in 1910. Placers have been found
on the west slope of the East Cordillera in Loja and Azuay
with gravel from 3 to 6 feet deep. The Collay, anciently
worked by Indians, has alluvium 20-35 feet thick, with gold
in grains and dust but in small quantities. The placers
of the small streams are believed to be paying only as
worked individually by the patient Indian. In Esmeraldas
there is platinum with the gold but in too small quantities
to be worth while. The mountain sections have good lodes
which might develop into paying propositions, but appearances
are judged less favorable than in some other quarters.</p>

<p><b>Coal.</b> Beds of coal are found in several places among
the mountains, but none have yet been successfully worked.
The Southern Railway has recently consumed eucalyptus
wood, well dried, in their locomotives.</p>

<p><b>Manganese.</b> Deposits are said to exist near Pomasqui,
from which it is expected to ship 200 tons of ore monthly
to the United States. Near San Antonio in Pichincha a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
deposit from 3 to 9 feet thick covers 21,000 square feet. The
ore runs from 46 to 53 per cent manganese.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Industries</span></h4>

<p><b>Panamá Hats.</b> As might be supposed the manufactures
of Ecuador are slightly developed, with no articles save
Panamá hats made for export. In this they rank third, following
cacao and tagua. The demand for the hats has increased
in recent years. They are due to the patient labor
of the natives. Made from two different kinds of plants,
the <i>paja toquilla</i>, and the <i>macora</i>, the finest hats are from the
first, those of average quality from the second, from which
material fine hammocks are also made. Both plants grow wild
6-10 feet high; but the <i>toquilla</i> is transplanted, placed four
feet apart, and kept free of weeds. The fan shaped leaves
of the <i>toquilla</i> rise directly from the ground. Conditions are
especially favorable to the plant in Manglar Alto in Manabí,
but it grows elsewhere along the coast. The portions used for
hats are separated before the leaves open, and picked only in
certain weather conditions. The <i>macora</i> grass grows wild on
the hills and is had for the gathering.</p>

<p>In Peru similar hats are made from Ecuador straw. In
order to prevent this a tax of one sucre a kilogram was
placed on the export of the straw, but without killing the
Peruvian industry. The finest Ecuadorian hats, which come
from Montecristi and Jipijapa in Manabí, are sold in Guayaquil
at high prices, but far less than in New York.</p>

<p>A shoe factory, cotton and woolen mills, breweries, ice
plants, tanneries, flour mills, saw mills, etc., not forgetting
chocolate, are locally important. Along the coast are many
maguey plants, from the fibre of which to make bags and
twine a profitable industry might be created. For the establishment
of a paper factory, the Government proposes, it is
reported, to grant valuable concessions to British capitalists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Investments</span></h4>

<p>From the list of Ecuador’s productions and exports, agriculture,
especially cacao, might seem to offer favorable opportunities;
to some gold mining might appeal or the possibilities
of petroleum. For many years engineering and
construction work of various kinds, including sanitation,
must present openings for capitalists, and for experts in
such matters. With forests so near the coast saw mills
and lumbering would undoubtedly be profitable. Stock raising
for local requirements is a fair possibility.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br><span class="small">PERU: AREA, HISTORY, GOVERNMENT, POPULATION,
ETC.</span></h3>
</div>


<p>More than a century ago, the distinguished scientist,
Alexander von Humboldt, declared that the country of Peru
would one day become the centre of the World’s colonization.
It has been called the richest in natural resources of
any country upon the globe, containing within its borders
every variety of climate and of natural or possible production,
together with wonderful fertility of soil and marvelous
wealth in minerals. Other countries make a similar claim.
To decide the question is impossible. Without intimate
acquaintance with all, even to express an opinion would
seem an impertinence.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Area, Population, Boundary</span></h4>

<p><b>Area.</b> Pending the decision of certain boundary disputes,
the area of this Republic can hardly be stated with
even approximate accuracy, for figures given vary over
200,000 square miles. The territory claimed by the Government,
including Tacna and Arica, with a vast domain over
which Ecuador and Colombia have asserted a right, covers
700,000 square miles. Had all claims been decided against
her, Peru would have fifth place in area among the South
American Republics; but as the arbitrators of her boundaries
with Brazil and Bolivia gave judgment largely in her
favor, she is likely to remain fourth with at least 540,000
square miles. With this figure Peru is ten times the size of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
New York State, and approximates the area of the entire
Atlantic slope of the United States.</p>

<p><b>Population.</b> As no census of Peru has been taken for
many years the population is merely estimated and a variety
of figures is given. The estimate of 5,800,000 appears probable;
this number would place Peru in the third or fourth
rank according to the figures assigned to Colombia.</p>

<p><b>Boundary.</b> The boundary of the country may be
slightly affected by the decision of arbitrators; as usually
given, Peru has Ecuador and a little of Colombia on the
north, Brazil and Bolivia east, Chile south, and the Pacific
Ocean on the west.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">History</span></h4>

<p>The name of Peru is always a reminder of the Incas,
and all but the utterly ignorant have heard the amazing tale
of the conquest of Peru by Pizarro. A few dates may here
be recalled. As early as 1527, Francisco Pizarro, incited
by rumors of prodigious wealth of gold in a country south
of Panamá, made a voyage of exploration in which he
landed at Tumbes and proceeded as far as Trujillo. Satisfied
with his discoveries he returned to Spain, to procure a royal
warrant for an invasion. In 1531, with Diego de Almagro,
Hernando de Luque, a priest, and subordinates, he set out
on his career of conquest. With 180 men, 67 of whom were
cavalry, in 1532 he crossed the desert and the first mountain
range, then descending to Cajamarca. How he treacherously
seized and later slew the Inca Prince, Atahuallpa, in
spite of the enormous gold ransom which had been furnished,
afterwards captured Cuzco, the Inca capital, and
in 1535 founded Lima on the banks of the Rimac is a Twice
Told Tale.</p>

<p>Quarrels developed soon after the conquest. Subsequently
to his return from Chile the nobler Almagro was executed
by order of his associate, Pizarro, who himself was assassinated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
in 1541 by former adherents of Almagro. For centuries
Lima was the seat of Spanish government in South
America and the residence of the Viceroy. Great wealth
of gold and silver had been extorted from the Incas in addition
to the ransom paid for Atahuallpa, and further riches
were later obtained from mines by forced labor of the
Indians. Severe exactions and cruelties excited one or two
insurrections, but in spite of vicissitudes of various kinds
the city of Lima was the continental centre of wealth and
culture for generations.</p>

<p>When in 1810 the spirit of independence began to manifest
itself in the colonies, it had less opportunity for development
in Peru. Not until San Martín came with an
army from Chile in 1820 did revolutionary activity become
general. Received with great enthusiasm, he was proclaimed
Protector of Peru. Her independence was declared July 28,
1821, which is the day they celebrate. General Bolívar,
coming from the north with an army, was met by San
Martín. A disagreement evidently occurred, which caused
San Martín to retire to Argentina; subsequently he withdrew
to Europe. A hero of the highest patriotism, courage,
skill, unselfish devotion, and sterling character, the name of
San Martín should be honored among us as is that of Washington
in South America. The year following Bolívar’s
arrival in Lima in 1823, a battle between royalists and
patriots occurred on the plateau of Junín, altitude 13,000
feet, when the patriots gained a complete victory. In December
of the same year, 1824, General Sucre gained the
hard-fought battle of Apurimac, which ended Spanish dominion
in South America.</p>

<p>More or less troublous times with brief intervals of harmony
followed the securing of independence, until the War
of the Pacific broke out in 1879. In accordance with a secret
treaty, Peru went to the assistance of Bolivia after the
Chilians had seized Antofagasta on account of a quarrel
over a nitrate tax. Following some successes, the Peruvian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
fleet was destroyed; the coast was exposed to the enemy.
In 1881 Lima was captured, and held until the signing of
the treaty of Ancón in 1883. In accordance with this treaty
the Province of Tarapacá was ceded to Chile. Tacna and
Arica were yielded for ten years, at the end of which time
the residents were to vote whether they desired to remain
with Chile or return to their former allegiance. The fact
that no vote has yet been taken, while Chile retains possession,
has for years caused much ill feeling and friction between
the two countries, which several times have been on
the verge of war.</p>

<p>Within the last ten years there have been several internal
disturbances in Peru and one revolution; these, however, are
short lived and do not affect the people generally or interfere
with business for more than a day or two; nor do the
revolutions derange concessions or the investments of foreign
capital.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Government</span></h4>

<p>The government is a centralized republic, based on the constitution
of 1860, revised in 1920. The President is now elected
for five years; he is ineligible for immediate reëlection. The
other two branches of government are of the usual form. Congress
has two Chambers, a Senate of 35 members and Deputies
110, both elected by direct vote. Alternates are chosen to
assume office in case of vacancy. There are also three local
legislatures. The President appoints the Prefects of Departments
and the Sub-prefects of Provinces; the Prefects name
the <i>Gobernadores</i> of the Districts. The President controls the
police of the country; the supervision of education is centralized.
The Judiciary has a Supreme Court at Lima, nine Superior
Courts in the chief cities, and Lower Courts in smaller
places.</p>

<p>Peruvian male citizens over 21 may vote, if a master employer,
a real estate owner, a tax payer, or able to read and
write.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>Peru has 22 separate divisions aside from Tacna, of which
three are littoral Provinces and the rest Departments; the latter
are divided into 118 Provinces, and these into 800 or more
Districts. The Departments and unattached Provinces, with
approximate area and population, their capitals, population, and
altitude are as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Population</span></h4>

<p>As previously stated, the population is largely an estimate,
but probably approaches 6,000,000. From the above approximate
figures it is evident that it is very unevenly distributed,
as it is in fact in all of the Republics. There are three principal
classes aside from the wild or uncivilized Indians of the <i>montaña</i>:
the whites, the real governing class, chiefly of Spanish
origin, some with a slight admixture of Indian blood; the mestizos,
more nearly half and half, white and Indian, largely the
artisan and tradesman class; the Indians, most numerous in the
sierra, much as in Inca days, but probably poorer in mental
and physical condition and in creature comforts than in the
earlier period. The population of the <i>montaña</i> in the lower
forest section beyond the mountains is wild Indian except for
a very small percentage of white and Indian gold diggers or
rubber gatherers. Even now, in spite of exploration for several
centuries, there are probably thousands who have never seen a
white man. The entire number of <i>montaña</i> Indians is estimated
(it can only be a guess) at perhaps 300,000. Of the
rest the proportion is very uncertain, but one writer gives it as
Indians 50 per cent, mestizos 35, whites 11 per cent, the rest
negroes, <i>zambos</i>, and Asiatics.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Education</span></h4>

<p>The opportunities for higher education are relatively
superior to those for primary, though this by law is free
and compulsory. But as no schools have been provided
in many Districts, not half of the children have been able
to attend, and the percentage of illiteracy is large. At the
moment, however, 1921, plans have been inaugurated to
remedy this state of affairs, and teachers have sailed from
the United States to aid in the further development of educational
facilities. There are four universities in Peru, that
of San Marcos in Lima, the oldest on this hemisphere; others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
of lesser scope and merit in Arequipa, Cuzco, and Trujillo.
Lima has also a School of Mines; one of Engineering, Mechanical,
Electrical, Industrial, and Architectural; one of
Arts and Trades; a Normal School, a Naval School at
Callao, and a Military Academy at Chorillos, a suburb of
Lima. There are secondary schools called <i>colegios</i> in the principal
cities, and private schools of high grade.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Press, Religion, Etc.</span></h4>

<p><b>Press.</b> Aside from official publications, the Press includes
newspapers and periodicals of considerable variety.
Lima has several good newspapers which have a wide circulation,
owing to the fact that they are carried free of
charge inside the Republic, as are literary and scientific
journals also. Some of the smaller towns have their own
newspapers.</p>

<p><b>Religion.</b> The religion of the country is Roman Catholic,
but other forms of worship are permitted. Provision
is made for the civil marriage of foreigners.</p>

<p><b>Postal and Telegraph Service.</b> Foreign letters and parcels
for most of the montaña region enter by way of the
Amazon River and Iquitos.</p>

<p>Telegraph service is much employed locally, as the cost
is only 40 centavos, 20 cents, for ten words to any part of
the country. The address and signature are counted, as in
all of the Republics. Additional words are at the same rate.
There are about 8000 miles of wire. The United States has
cable connection with Peru by three lines. Lima has wireless
connection with Iquitos, a distance of 650 miles in a
straight line, over a mountain wall more than three miles
high. Other wireless stations are at Callao, Pisco, Chala,
Ilo, Leticia, El Canto, Orellana.</p>

<p>There are many telephone systems with nearly 200,000
miles of wire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p><b>Money</b> is of gold, silver, and copper. The gold Peruvian
<i>libra</i> is the equivalent of the English sovereign, and in general
they circulate interchangeably. The <i>libra</i> is divided into ten
<i>soles</i>; a <i>sol</i>, about 50 cents (48.6), into 100 <i>centavos</i>.</p>

<p>The <b>Metric System</b>, legal for weights and measures, must
be employed in the Custom Houses and in other Government
offices. Old Spanish standards are also used in Lima
and quite generally in the country: the <i>vara</i>, 33¹⁄₃ inches, the
<i>libra</i>, a trifle over a pound, <i>arroba</i>, <i>25 libras</i>, <i>quintal</i>, <i>100 libras</i>,
<i>fanegada</i>, a little over 7 acres, etc.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br><span class="small">PERU: PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The country of Peru has three distinct sections longitudinally:
the Coast region, the Sierra, and the <i>Montaña</i>—the
first well known and fairly settled, the second with the greater
population, the third having much the largest area, but thinly
peopled chiefly by wild Indians, and not thoroughly explored.
The term <i>montaña</i>, one of the Spanish words for mountain,
in Peru is generally applied to the forest region on the eastern
slope of the Andes and the plains beyond; the plateau and
mountain section with the narrow valleys included form the
sierra.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Coastal Region</span></h4>

<p>The coast of Peru is a strange one, presenting to the
uninformed traveler a series of surprises. One expects to
find it hot in the tropics, at least at sea level; but on ship-board
sailing south when 3° below the equator, at least in
the winter season, which it must be remembered is during
our summer, warm clothing if not heavy underwear is necessary
with blankets at night. One is amazed too to find
at Paita (for some steamers the first port of call), a real
desert, in striking contrast to the rich vegetation near the
Guayas River.</p>

<p>The chief reason for the comparatively cool temperatures
experienced on the entire coast of Peru is found in the
Humboldt or Antarctic current which flows from the icy
realms far south, with chilling effect, close along the shore
to the region of the equator, where near the most western
points of the continent it turns west across the Pacific.</p>

<p>The high mountains too, here quite near the shore, have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
some cooling influence and are a prime cause of the existing
desert. The hot moist winds, which in the equatorial
regions blow west from the Atlantic dropping more or less
of their vapor on the way, on reaching the highest Andes
lose all the rest, as every bit of the moisture is condensed
by the freezing mountain sides; the average height of the
range in Peru is above 17,000 feet. After passing the mountains
the winds descend cool and dry to the plains. The
damp chilly winds which come north with the Antarctic
current, as they blow over the shore, find this warmer than
the ocean, so the moisture is not condensed.</p>

<p>Thus it is that the coast of Peru with that of northern
Chile, being practically rainless, is called a desert, though in
Peru it is not wholly barren. From her mountains 58
streams come down toward the Pacific, though not all reach
the ocean or last throughout the year. In these valleys
there is green, a beautiful and welcome contrast to the
desert; in most of them are irrigation and agriculture.
Because the nitrates have not been washed out of the soil
by rain, where a suitable water supply can be provided, the
land constitutes one of the finest agricultural regions on the
globe.</p>

<p>In proportion to its length the area of the coast line is
small, as the Andes here run closer to the shore than in
Ecuador, especially in the central portion, where spurs from
the main range sometimes end in bold bluffs rising 500 feet
from the sea. In general the width of the coast land varies
from 20 to 50 miles, in places reaching to 100. Unfortunately
the coast is slightly indented by gulfs and bays and
therefore has few good harbors.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Sierra</span></h4>

<p>In the sierra country we find the greatest development
of the mountain system of the Andes attained in its entire
course. For the most part it here consists of three ranges,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
the Maritime, the Central, and the East Cordillera. The first
two, near together, are regarded as of similar origin, separated
during ages by the action of water. They include volcanoes
and mineral springs; and in some parts of the lofty
region between the two, cold alpine lakes, sources of coast
rivers and also of Amazon tributaries.</p>

<p><b>The Maritime Cordillera</b> is not connected with the coast
ranges of Chile, but is a continuation of that cordillera which
forms the eastern limit of the coastal Chilian desert and the
western boundary of the great Bolivian plateau. In Bolivia
and Southern Peru it is a volcanic chain with some peaks of
great height, over 20,000 feet. Though generally quiescent,
one volcano in Peru south of Arequipa in the year 1700
erupted continuously for two weeks. El Misti, altitude
19,200 feet, above Arequipa is well known. From the summit
a little smoke may be seen in the depths of the crater.
The volcanoes seem to have some connection with earthquakes,
with which this region is often affected. Though
the quakes are mostly slight tremors, severe shocks occur;
70 of a destructive nature have been reported since 1570.
The worst, which in 1746 completely destroyed Callao, was
followed by 220 shocks within 24 hours. The city was overwhelmed
by a tidal wave 80 feet high from which not half
a dozen inhabitants escaped. The earthquake of 1868, which
was felt over most of South America, half destroyed Arequipa,
and tidal waves swept over Arica and Iquique. In
1877 nearly half of the southern ports were submerged; in
1906 a good portion of Valparaiso, Chile, was laid in ruins,
a fate within a period of 12 months shared by San Francisco
and by Kingston, Jamaica. At about 10° S. Lat. the Maritime
Cordillera separates into two ranges for a distance of
100 miles, the Cordillera Negra, and the Cordillera Blanca,
the two enclosing the Huailas Valley; north of where the
Santa River breaks through toward the coast, the Black
Range begins to subside, the Maritime continuing to Ecuador
in a single chain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p><b>The Central Cordillera</b> is the true divide, forming the
continental watershed. A single river, the Marañon, breaks
through in its lower northern part, while 20 coast streams
rising in the Central cut the Maritime range; the East Cordillera
is fractured by six Peruvian rivers, the Marañon,
Huallaga, Perené, Mantaro, Apurimac, Vilcamayu, and Paucartambo,
all but the first being affluents of the Ucayali,
which some authorities call a tributary of the Marañon.
Oftener these two are said to unite to form the Amazon.</p>

<p><b>The East Cordillera.</b> While the Central Cordillera is
volcanic in part, the East is of Silurian formation, older and
non-volcanic except at the edge of Lake Titicaca. The last,
in Bolivia a splendid range, is lower in Peru. It has the
high plateau region on the west; east is the Amazon Basin
into which its spurs extend for varying distances. The
Central and Eastern Andes are connected by a transverse
mountain knot at Vilcanota, or Cuzco, while a similar knot
occurs at Cerro de Pasco. Farther north the Central Cordillera
separates the valleys of the Marañon and the Huallaga,
while the eastern Andes is between the latter and the
Ucayali. The three ranges are clearly defined much of the
way in Peru, and back of Chimbote in the section including
the Huailas Valley there are four.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Montaña</span></h4>

<p>The third longitudinal division in Peru, the Trans-Andine,
usually referred to as the <i>montaña</i>, is the region of
subtropical and tropical forest. It is traversed by great rivers,
largely navigable. Partly in the sierra country are the Marañon,
600, and the Huallaga, 400 miles long, before their union; 150
miles beyond they are joined by the Ucayali, a great river with
a course of 600 miles, more navigable than the other two. These
three rivers with their affluents drain the northern and the central
part of Peru. The streams of the southern portion are
tributary to the Madre de Dios which flows into the Beni,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
the latter uniting with the Mamoré to form the Madeira. The
<i>montaña</i> section, 800 miles from north to south, has a sub-tropical
region on the lower slopes of the Andes, the branches
of which run out 60 or 80 miles towards the lowlands, and the
tropical forests of the latter. In the northern section a considerable
district between the Huallaga and the Ucayali rivers,
traversed by the Andes, is composed of grassy plains called the
Pampa del Sacramento. Some of this northern region is called
the <i>montaña</i>, having its characteristics, although not east of
the East Cordillera.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Climate</span></h4>

<p>The climate of Peru, a country like those preceding
entirely within the tropics, has similar though greater variations
from altitude, as its mountains are higher, its table-lands
more lofty and extensive. With a larger area of temperate
climate on its highlands, it has also, in wide contrast
to the others, a fairly temperate region along its entire coast.
This last, however, differs from the ordinary climate of the
temperate zone, as does that at an altitude of 6000 or 8000
feet, in having weather which is never so hot as often in
almost all parts of the United States, and at the same time
is never so cold. At Lima, eight miles from the sea, the
mean temperature is 66°; in the warm season, December
to March, the mercury occasionally climbs a little above
80°, and in winter, June to September, it rarely falls below
50°. It is a little warmer farther north, and on the broad
desert in the sun it is hot, hotter, hottest; as I once found
to my sorrow. But comparatively few persons have occasion
to travel there, and when they do they are likely to
journey in the late afternoon and night; a more agreeable
season for such cross country riding. On the deserts, too,
it is colder at night as happens the world over.</p>

<p>The winter season at Lima is damp and cloudy, the
atmosphere raw and chilly; with the mercury below 60° a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
fire would be most acceptable, but they never have one. On
account of the dampness and the evaporation from the heat
of the body, the cold is felt more than the temperature warrants,
so that overcoats and warm wraps may be donned
for sitting in the house. Conditions vary on other parts of
the coast; in general there is less fog and greater heat
farther north and more fog and mist towards the south.
Mollendo is particularly damp and disagreeable. Some
shore places near Lima have much more sunshine than that
city, and 20 miles from the sea one gets beyond the fog belt
into a region of perpetual spring. Although the climate
of Lima is said to be rather enervating to permanent residents,
many dwellers in the temperate zone would prefer it
to that of any other coast city within the tropics.</p>

<p>On the highlands the climate is widely diverse. The
seasons are opposite, as there it is the dry season from May
to October, when it is damp on the coast, while the chief
precipitation above occurs during their summer, the dry
months below. At an altitude of 7000 or 8000 feet the climate
is considered agreeable, at Arequipa averaging 57°, at
Cajamarca 52°. At 12,000 to 15,000 feet it is generally cool,
perhaps bracing to those accustomed thereto, but often trying
to the visitor, who is likely to suffer from <i>soroche</i>, the name
applied to mountain sickness.</p>

<p>In the <i>montaña</i> there is variation due to altitude, as in the
sierra, as this region includes the forested district from an
altitude of nearly 10,000 feet down to 1000 or less in the basin
of the large Amazon tributaries. From 3000 to 7000 feet the
climate is delightful to those who do not enjoy greater contrasts.
Huánuco, altitude 6270 feet, has an annual temperature
of 74°, other places a lower temperature, and far down,
as at Iquitos, a higher. Most of the region is healthful, as is also
the sierra, for persons of sound constitution under suitable
living conditions and employing intelligent care. In some parts
of the lowlands malaria is occasional or permanent, in other
parts it is unknown.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br><span class="small">PERU: CAPITAL, DEPARTMENTS, AND CHIEF
CITIES</span></h3>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Capital</span></h4>

<p><b>Lima</b>, the capital of Peru, on the banks of the Rimac
eight miles from the port, Callao, is a city of picturesque
charm. Its population, with its suburbs 200,000, is no indication
of its commercial importance or of its elegance as a
social centre. One of the three cities of the world where
the best Spanish is spoken, some impartial critics say that
in this respect it is unrivalled in the New World. Social
amenities, everywhere important, are here peculiarly requisite
for agreeable and successful business relations. Parisian
elegance is seen on the narrow streets, and in one story
dwellings as well as in larger mansions. The great cathedral
is called the finest in South America.</p>

<p>The city takes pride in its numerous churches, its plazas,
the excellent shops on the narrow streets, its University,
founded in 1551, its museum, its new theatres, perhaps even
in its bull-ring, the second largest in the world. As in the
other West Coast cities, the hotels are inadequate (a new
one is contracted for), but the old Maury long had the reputation
of being the best on the Coast, and the excellence of
its meals once rejoiced the heart even of a New York club
man and his East Indian valet. Of course the city has
modern conveniences, sky-scrapers happily excepted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Individual Departments</span></h4>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Coastal Divisions</span> follow beginning at the north.</p>

<p><b>Tumbes</b>, the Province farthest north, is distinguished
from the rest of the coast by the fact that, bordering on
Ecuador and the edge of the Gulf of Guayaquil, it partakes
of the nature of that region, its north shore being covered
with vegetation. (The adjoining Department of Piura,
because of its proximity to the Ecuador forests and moisture,
receives a rare torrential shower.) Rivers crossing Tumbes
permit of irrigation where needed. The agricultural products
are sugar, tobacco, coffee, and cacao. The oil wells are
of great importance. Coal and other minerals are found.</p>

<p>Tumbes, the capital, on the Tumbes River, is connected
by a narrow gauge railway with its port, Pizarro, seven
miles distant, where steamers on their way to Guayaquil
call every week or two.</p>

<p><b>Piura</b>, the first Department south of Tumbes, is mainly
desert, with some fertile irrigated valleys. The culture of
a native cotton resembling wool is a leading industry. Other
exports are Panamá hats and hides. Near the coast are
important oil wells. Paita, with one of the best harbors on
the coast, is the first port of call for some of the express
steamers from Panamá.</p>

<p>Piura, capital of the Department, mean temperature 78°,
is in an irrigated valley 60 miles from the desert port Paita,
with which it is connected by rail. A line of narrower gauge
goes on to Catacaos, population 20,000, six miles distant but
nearer the sea, where 300,000 Panamá hats are made yearly.
They may be bought at Paita for one fourth, perhaps for
one eighth of the price commonly asked for the finer ones
in New York. The main railway is to be prolonged from
Piura to the town of Moropón. Farther south, from Bayovar,
a small port on the Bay of Sechura, a railroad leads 30
miles to the sulphur mines of Reventazón; but the sulphur,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
an important export, must be cleared from the custom house
at Paita.</p>

<p><b>Lambayeque</b>, south of Piura, contains large estates of
sugar and rice, the chief exports. It has one of the primary
coast ports, Etén (population 3000), but a poor one, merely
an open roadstead where there is always a swell, at times
so severe that debarking passengers must be lowered in a
sort of hogshead by windlass, chain, and pulley to the launch
or small boat alongside. Freight lowered to lighters is
likely here to get a particularly hard bump. An iron pier
2000 feet long is for the use of the lighters.</p>

<p>Chiclayo, the capital, is 41 miles by rail from Etén. By
this railway and its branches, Ferreñafe, Lambayeque, and
Patapó may also be reached. From Pimentel, a minor port,
a shorter railway runs to Chiclayo. From the Lobos
Islands off the coast much guano was formerly taken.</p>

<p><b>La Libertad</b>, the larger Department following, has two
primary ports, the first, Pacasmayo, a short sail from Etén.
From Pacasmayo 85 miles of railway lead up country to the
towns Guadalupe and Chilete. From Chilete the road
should be carried over the Cordillera to the important city
of Cajamarca, 50 miles beyond, whither Pizarro marched
nearly 400 years ago; but the grades would be difficult and
the road awaits the supply of more pressing needs. Another
long pier serves the port of Pacasmayo, from which are
shipped sugar, rice, fruit, etc. Sixty-six miles farther is the
primary port of Salaverry, population 5000.</p>

<p>Trujillo, the capital of the Department, is eight miles
distant; beyond is the Chicama Valley, noted for its splendid
sugar estates. A railway 75 miles long going up the valley
to Ascope, does a large business. An extension planned to
the plateau above, 12,900 feet, will pass extensive coal fields
at Huanday, and reach copper and silver mines at Queruvilca.
A maximum grade of 6¹⁄₂ per cent would make the
construction expensive. Another road from the sugar lands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
is being constructed to the better port, Malabrigo. A little
north of Salaverry is the minor port of Huanchaco, which
also exports much sugar, though the chief shipment is from
Salaverry.</p>

<p><b>Ancash</b>, the next Department, which is still larger, has
five minor ports, one of which, Chimbote, should soon become
a primary. For this expectation there are several
reasons: first, the harbor, land locked by a long peninsula
and several islands, is called the finest on the entire West
Coast below Panamá. It has an area of 36 square miles
without a rock below its placid surface. Though now with
but an ordinary iron pier for lighters, docks approachable
by the largest ships could be arranged on an island, which
a bridge over a 200 yard channel would easily connect with
the main land. There are two other entrances, one half a
mile across.</p>

<p>The American capitalist, Henry Meiggs, the prime mover
in the construction of the South and Central Peruvian Railways,
had the foresight in the early seventies to perceive
the great commercial possibilities of this harbor. He planned
a city on the shore and began a railway to extend up the
Santa River Valley to Huarás, 167 miles. The road bed
had been constructed 80 miles, the rails laid 60, when the
Chilian war broke out. The invaders, after capturing Chimbote,
carried off the rolling stock and supplies and destroyed
what else they could. Subsequently the project remained
long in abeyance, the road being operated for 35 miles only;
but after several recent concessions and delays with little
work accomplished, the Government has taken over the
line and is pushing forward the extension from the point
already attained, La Limeña, 65 miles from Chimbote.
Work was begun July, 1919, on a branch line to coal fields
near Ancos, 15¹⁄₂ miles, which later will pass near two copper
deposits and through Huamachuco and Cajabamba. After
the first few miles the main road follows the Santa River,
which enters the ocean a few miles north of the harbor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>The Santa has the distinction of being the largest river
in Peru flowing into the Pacific Ocean. Rising among the
heavily snow covered peaks of the White Cordillera, though
nowhere navigable it has a large water supply for irrigation,
made use of by the Incas. It could easily be made available
for a large district back of Chimbote. At present the railway
serves only a few sugar plantations on the lower part
of the river’s course, but its further construction will open
up immense coal fields, and farther on in the Huailas Valley
great mineral deposits of gold, silver, etc., and a fine though
limited agricultural district which already has a large population.</p>

<p>The Huailas Valley has on the east the Cordillera Blanca,
whose splendid snow capped summits rise to an altitude of
20,000 to 22,000 feet; on the west the Cordillera Negra reaches
a height of 17,000 to 18,000 feet; the passes into the valley are
above 14,000. The floor of the valley rises from 3000 feet
at the north to 10,000 at Huarás and 11,000 at Recuay. Along
the way are the considerable towns of Caráz, Yungay, Carhuaz,
and Huaráz, capital of the Department, each with populations
of from 5000 to 10,000, besides the people at <i>haciendas</i>
and at mining centers on either hand. This has been called
the richest and most thickly settled portion of Peru. All
sub-tropical and temperate productions flourish here at
various elevations; the mineral riches may rival the Klondike
as the scenic splendor surpasses that of Chamonix.
East of Yungay rises the magnificent twin-peaked Huascarán,
the first and only ascent of which was made by the
author with two Swiss guides, September 2, 1908; the north
peak, altitude 21,812 feet, is still, 1921, the highest point in
all America yet attained by any North or South American.</p>

<p>The only difficulty in the construction of the railway is
where the Santa River breaks through the Black Cordillera
to turn towards the coast, the narrow gorge being impracticable
even for pedestrians. In this region and beyond are
immense coal fields. These, chiefly anthracite and semi-anthracite,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
therefore non-coking, some people believed
worthless, being ignorant that for many purposes hard coal
is more valuable than soft. However there are also beds
of bituminous. The coal deposits continue in the lateral
valleys, where the owners use them merely for their own
households. Samples run over 82 per cent carbon. A quarter
of a mile from Caráz (population 8000) coal may be mined
and put on trucks at $1.50 a ton. The Chuquisaca River
from the north joins the Santa just before that breaks
through the Cordillera. This Department is very mountainous.
Besides the Santa, four rivers descend to the sea,
<i>i.e.</i>, they do sometimes; for, rising on the west of the Black
Range, obviously so called because it has little snow on it,
these rivers are often dry, yet they serve to irrigate many sugar
plantations. At the mouth of the Santa River north of Chimbote
is the village Santa, an occasional port of call for the
<i>caletero</i> (not express) boats, which regularly visit several ports
below: Samanco, 27 miles of desert from Chimbote, Casma,
after 50 miles more, and Huarmey, 55 beyond. Back of
Samanco is the Nepeña River Valley with two large sugar
plantations; and high in the Black Range, Colquipocro, one
of the richest silver mines worked in Peru. Some of the
selected ore ran as high as $2000 a ton, and large quantities
averaged $200 when silver was 50 cents an ounce. Samanco
and Casma are the usual ports for entering the Huailas
Valley; Chimbote also serves.</p>

<p><b>Lima.</b> The Departments of Lima and Ica follow, in
which the mountains come closer to the shore than in the
greater part of the country, and the rivers except at the
extreme south are nearer together. Thus the Departments
exhibit much verdure, a larger proportion of the country
being devoted to agriculture. A minor port of Lima is Supe,
followed by Huacho, of more importance and connected with
the capital by rail, 150 miles, passing Ancón, a frequented
summer seashore resort.</p>

<p><b>Callao</b>, the port of Lima and the chief port of Peru, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
with its suburbs a little Province all by itself, surrounded
by the Department of Lima except on the ocean side.</p>

<p>Cerro Azul is a more southern port in the Department
of Lima, serving a very mountainous section, with fertile
valleys producing sugar, cotton, vegetables, etc., and in the
mountains many minerals.</p>

<p><b>Ica</b> is an extremely fertile Department, raising very fine
grapes and other fruits, sugar cane and cotton; also corn,
alfalfa, divi-divi, and ají, a kind of pepper much used in
Peru and other countries. Wine making is a very important
industry. Minerals exist, but are not much worked except a
silver mine.</p>

<p>Ica, the capital, centre of the finest grape country in the
Republic, is 46 miles by rail from Pisco, the chief port, and
the most important one between Callao and Mollendo.
Lomas is a smaller port in the Department. Ica has some
good land uncultivated, but needing irrigation.</p>

<p><b>Arequipa</b>, the last littoral Department, has five minor
ports besides the primary port, Mollendo, second in importance
in Peru; but the port is a very poor one, no real harbor
at all. Chala is a port of call for some steamers, but the
rest are very minor: Camaná, at the mouth of the Majes
River which comes down from Mt. Coropuna, Quilca, Matarani,
and Islay, the last two not far north of Mollendo, and
with better harbors. Along here the mountains are farther
back and some have much snow, so that several rivers
present good possibilities for additional irrigation. Cotton,
sugar, and grapes grow in the valleys; corn, potatoes, and
cereals higher up. There is a variety of mineral products:
the most important, silver from Cailloma; but gold, copper,
lead, coal, borax, sulphur, manganese, alum, gypsum, are
found, and some of them are exported.</p>

<p>The Southern Railway of Peru, leading up from Mollendo,
is an important line which will be referred to later.
Back of the coastal bluffs, which rise on irregular slopes
3000 feet or more, is a desert plateau of especial interest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
on account of the sand dunes 10-12 feet high which move
slowly over it.</p>

<p><b>Moquegua</b>, a Province south, the last district held by
Peru, has a primary port, Ilo, from which a railway 62 miles
long extends to its capital, Moquegua. The soil of the Province
is especially adapted to grapes and olives, which with
wine and oil are the chief exports. Many varieties of minerals
are known to exist here in quantity.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Sierra Region</span></h4>

<p>This, perhaps the best populated of the three sections,
comprises seven Departments, some of which run over or
down into the montaña, as most of the Coast Departments
run up into the sierra.</p>

<p><b>Cajamarca</b>, bordering on Ecuador, is the first Department
at the north, a rather long one, running south back
of Piura, Lambayeque, and part of Libertad, which last is
also on the south, as in its southern part it extends over the
West Cordillera and beyond the Marañon. Cajamarca has
that river on the east separating it from Amazonas. Communication
with the outside world is poor, the best by way
of Pacasmayo. An extension of the railway from this port
is hoped for. The highlands favor cattle and sheep breeding;
the valleys produce cereals, coffee, and sugar. Of course
there are minerals.</p>

<p>Cajamarca, the capital, famed for the seizure and murder
of Atahuallpa by Pizarro and the slaughter or dispersion of
his army, is an important town and distributing centre, with
many industries; leather goods, mining, cotton and woolen
cloth, etc.</p>

<p><b>Huánuco</b>, the next Sierra Department, does not touch
Cajamarca. East of Ancash, it has Junín on the south, and
Loreto east and north. Traversed by the Central and the
East Cordilleras, by the Marañon, Huallaga, and Pachítea
Rivers, it has the Ucayali as its eastern boundary. At the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
northeast corner the Pachítea flows into the Ucayali, both
rivers being navigable. The central route from Lima to
Iquitos goes down the Pachítea. All kinds of riches are
here, but communication is too difficult to make them very
valuable at the moment. Quicksilver, coal, iron, and copper
are found, gold and silver as a matter of course, agricultural
products of great variety.</p>

<p>Huánuco, the capital, with a good climate, is 68 miles
from Cerro de Pasco, on the Huallaga River. It is an important
place with varied industries including sugar mills.</p>

<p><b>Junín</b>, south of Huánuco, a very large and rich Department,
is east of Ancash and Lima, has Huancavelica south,
and Cuzco and Loreto east. It has three important districts,
better known than those in the Departments farther north:
the mountain knot and range at the west, the plateau, and
the montaña section running down to the Ucayali River,
which separates it from Loreto. Lake Junín, 36 miles long
and 7 wide, altitude 13,322 feet, is the second largest Andean
Lake. Near by, occurred the battle of August 6, 1824.</p>

<p>In Junín are the head waters of important rivers: in the
northwest corner the lakes which are the source of the
Marañon, Santa Ana and others; the Jauja or Mantaro flows
south from Lake Junín, uniting with the Apurimac later to
form the Ené; the Perené, rising on the montaña side of the
mountain far down unites with the Ené to form the Tambo,
which soon joins the Urubamba then becoming the Ucayali.
The smaller Pichis and Palcazu unite to form the Pachítea
of the Department of Huánuco. Junín contains immense
mineral wealth; among other mines the famous ones of
Cerro de Pasco; large stocks of cattle and more sheep.
Cereals, corn, potatoes, and other vegetables and fruits grow
in the valleys of the plateau, which has an altitude of
13,000 to 14,000 feet, with a temperature of 22°-65°. In the
tropical east are plantations of coca, coffee, cacao, sugar, and
fruit.</p>

<p>Cerro de Pasco, the capital, will be referred to later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p><b>Huancavelica</b>, a smaller Department directly south,
touches Lima on the west, has Ica west and south, and
Ayacucho east. This is a Sierra Department exclusively,
all high mountains, plateau, a few alpine lakes, but with
several deep cañons in which flow the rivers, at the north
the Mantaro. Minerals are the chief wealth. Famous since
they were opened in 1566 are the quicksilver mines; but
since they were buried years ago by a cave-in not much
quicksilver has been extracted till a very recent resumption
of activity.</p>

<p>Huancavelica, the capital, is an important mining centre
though reached with some difficulty from Huancayo or Ica.
Here above 12,000 feet the production of wool might be
expected; there are cotton mills also.</p>

<p><b>Ayacucho</b>, a peculiarly shaped Department twice the size
of the preceding, runs to a point on the north between the
Mantaro and Apurimac Rivers. It has Huancavelica and
Ica on the west, Arequipa on the south and southeast, and
Apurimac and Cuzco east. This also is mostly highland,
with temperate zone agriculture, cattle and sheep, and with
varied mineral riches.</p>

<p>Ayacucho, the capital, is a considerable and important
city, but a long way to go from anywhere. Mining and
other industries are engaged in.</p>

<p><b>Apurimac</b>, much smaller, has Ayacucho northwest and
southwest, a bit of Arequipa south, and Cuzco southeast and
northeast. The Department is highland, but lower than at
the north, with great grazing ground and forests, with fertile
soil raising temperate and sub-tropical products, and
with the inevitable minerals.</p>

<p>Abancay, the capital, is most accessible from Cuzco or
from the port of Chala. It is a small city, of some interest.</p>

<p><b>Cuzco</b>, the largest Sierra Department, with a little of
Junín has Ayacucho and Apurimac west, Arequipa south,
Puno southeast and east, with Madre de Dios, Loreto, and
Brazil on the north. The Apurimac River to which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
Urubamba is nearly parallel, forms most of its western
boundary, both rivers flowing a little west of north. The
upper waters of the Purús, and Madre de Dios flow north,
south, and east. Stock raising is carried on and there are
minerals, but agriculture is the chief industry. Cuzco is
famed for the excellence of its cacao, also for its cocoa and
coffee; it has large sugar plantations as well. Though with
mountainous highlands, it has much territory lower.</p>

<p>Cuzco, the capital, world famed since its conquest by
Pizarro, is beautifully situated at the head of the side-valley
of the Huatanay River. Interesting from its historic associations,
its massive ruins, and its picturesque charm, it is
also of commercial importance.</p>

<p><b>Puno</b>, the last Department of the sierra, has Madre de
Dios on the north, Cuzco, Arequipa, and Moquegua west,
Chile and Bolivia south, and Bolivia east. The Department,
mostly highland, includes the western part of Lake Titicaca.
It contains many minerals, and has a large output of
gold. The production of wool, including the alpaca and
vicuña, is highly important. Potatoes, barley, etc., are
grown.</p>

<p>Puno, the capital, a centre of mineral and woolen activities,
is the head of Peruvian navigation on Lake Titicaca
and a meeting place of the two tribes or races, the
Quichuas and the Aymarás, the latter, residents of northern
Bolivia. The town is an important centre of traffic.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Montaña Region</span></h4>

<p>This region comprising nearly two thirds of Peru embraces
the eastern forest country, the eastern slopes of the
East Cordillera and at the north the lower slopes of the
other ranges. The region has much rain, many large navigable
rivers, and dense tropical forests rich in useful plants,
fine hard woods, and rubber trees. It has some settlements
on the river banks and on higher lands, and in the forests,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
Indians, some of whom are peaceable and friendly, others
who might have been so had they not been badly treated
by whites of various nationalities, others still who have
never seen the white man and do not wish to. Three of
these Departments border on Ecuador, the most western,
Amazonas, with Cajamarca on the west, La Libertad south,
and San Martín east. The last Department, more than
twice the size of Amazonas, has Loreto on the east and
south. It is traversed by the Central Cordillera and by the
Huallaga River, navigable to the important port of Yurimaguas,
but for steamers not much farther. The immense
Department Loreto, touching Huánuco and Cuzco on the
south, with Brazil on the east, is with Madre de Dios naturally
the least known and least populated portion of Peru.
It is traversed by the Ucayali, and by the Amazon both
above and for some distance below Iquitos, to which port
ocean steamers regularly ascend. Madre de Dios, east of
Cuzco and north of Puno, has been little explored. A few
rubber and mining concessions have been slightly worked.
Its future will come with transportation.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br><span class="small">PERU: PORTS AND INTERIOR TRANSPORTATION</span></h3>
</div>


<p>From the physical character of Peru, it is evident that
inland communication and traffic is of extraordinary difficulty.
The countries previously mentioned and most of
those to follow have rivers by which access to the interior
may be gained. In Colombia the Pacific coast barrier is
not half so high, and another way is open from the Caribbean.
Venezuela presents several doorways, Ecuador also;
but in Peru, entrance by navigable rivers would be to journey
over 2000 miles from Pará in Brazil at the mouth of
the Amazon, then arriving only at the back door, remote
indeed from the busy civilized life at the front. Some few
do come in and go out that way, but not many.</p>

<p>Peru’s front is happily 1200-1300 miles long, but then a
wall! and in places not one only; back of that another and
another; between each two a deep, deep hollow; climbs,
up and down, up and down, to gain the fertile <i>montaña</i>; or,
in the central section, where it might seem easy going after
having surmounted the high wall to the lofty plateau, there
are hills if not dales, with few level spots. Do not imagine
that a table-land is like a table! The country is rolling
where not mountainous; nor is that all. The various rivers
that wind about flowing now south now north, southeast
and northwest, with branches from any direction, these are
not simple little rivers, a few or many feet deep, which require
merely an ordinary bridge; but whether deep or shallow
they are liable to be and generally are at the bottom
of a cañon 300 or 3000 feet deep, the top of which may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
a mile or two across. For a railway to descend to such
depths and climb up the other side, not once but the many
times needful for a road traversing the length of Peru is
for a sparsely inhabited country, governmentally poor, quite
impossible. Hence the slowness of Peru’s development
despite its wonderful riches.</p>

<p>When some years ago the Pan American Railway from
New York to Buenos Aires was projected, investigation was
made of practicable routes by the United States Government.
The way in Ecuador is plain and in Colombia there
is little choice; but in Peru the question of highland, low
coast, or far interior was to be solved. The coast seemed
less desirable as along here one could go by water. Moreover,
the Maritime Cordillera for a long distance is so near
the sea with so many spurs coming down to the coast, or
as in Southern Peru a bluff several hundred or thousand feet
high with its feet in the sea is so cut every little way by
one of those 58 streams in a very deep cañon, that it was
not more inviting than the plateau region above, where the
road would be much more serviceable. Plateau was the
decision; but for the Great War, money might soon be forthcoming;
as it is, long delay is probable before the road is
completed. As for inland transportation therefore, it may
be said that it is carried on mainly by sea, which is no joke
but stern reality; accordingly coast service is well provided.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Coast Service</span></h4>

<p>British, Chilian, Peruvian, formerly German, and now
American steamers sail along the coast, some express from
Panamá, calling at Callao and Mollendo only; others, express
also, call at the other primary ports, Paita, Etén, Pacasmayo,
Salaverry, Pisco, and Ilo; still others, <i>caletero</i>, call at
the 20 minor ports also. From many of these ports, as we
have seen, railways extend some distance into the interior,
generally as far as they can go without taking a stiff grade.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
Beyond the termini and in some cases directly from the
ports, freight is carried by mules, burros, or llamas, though
in but few places do the latter come down to the sea, their
use being confined chiefly to the region of the sierra. In the
old Inca days the fleet footed Indians sped over the narrow
trails, often carrying heavy burdens. Horses were introduced
by the Spaniards; riding is universal, as almost everywhere
it is the only means of travel, from the coast to the
mountain region and within that section; roads aside from
bridle trails are almost non existent. Even in the thickly
settled and rich Huailas Valley there was not a wheeled
vehicle in 1908; there is no way by which they could be
carried in except in pieces. The iron horse, however, within
the last half century has begun to make its way.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Chief Port</span></h4>

<p><b>Callao.</b> Although Peru has other primary ports which
should be visited by commercial men, Callao and Lima are
the chief centre of commerce for the greater part of the
country. Both cities are of course provided with good
electric car service, lights, and telephones; they are connected
by an electric and a steam railway, the latter, a part
of the Central Railway of Peru, which climbs to the interior
heights. The double track electric road on a broad boulevard,
the most popular connection between the two cities,
makes the ride in 28 minutes. The site of the port, Callao,
population 35,000, was chosen with discretion, as except for
Chimbote it has the best harbor below Panamá. It ranks
in traffic as the fourth American port on the entire Pacific,
following Seattle, San Francisco, and Valparaiso. Callao
has been distinguished as the only port south of Panamá
with docks accessible to large ships, though, as the accommodations
are inadequate, passing coastal steamers usually
anchor half a mile away, employing lighters for cargo; recently,
steam launches serve passengers, heavy baggage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
going in row boats. A floating dry dock receives ships of
8000 tons.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Railways to the Interior</span></h4>

<p><b>The Central Railway.</b> In spite of the enormous difficulties
of making a roadbed up a steep cañon or on the face
of a bluff, bridging torrents, and tunneling side buttresses
and mountain ranges, two railroads, both monuments of
skill and perseverance, climb from the coast to the plateau,
the Central, and the Southern Railways of Peru. The first,
a standard gauge line from Callao begun in 1870 by the
American financier, Henry Meiggs, was in 1876 completed
as far as Chicla, 88 miles. On account of troubles resulting
from the Chilian war, it did not reach Oroya, long the terminus,
till 1893. The road follows up the Rimac Valley,
which, however, is so steep and narrow that detours into
side valleys are necessary, as into the Verrugas, which is
crossed by a bridge 225 feet high, one of 67 bridges on the
journey. Many curves, tunnels, and V’s are also needed to
gain in 7¹⁄₂ hours, with no more than a 4 per cent grade,
an elevation of 15,665 feet at a distance from the sea in a
straight line of less than 100 miles. Frequently the floor of
the cañon has room only for the rushing stream, and the
road passes high up on the slope or cliff, at one point, 575
feet, or through one of the 57 tunnels. Some of the cliffs
are more than one third of a mile in perpendicular height.
The road is considered in some respects the most wonderful
of the world’s railways. A branch 10 miles long from Ticlio
to Morococha, reaching an altitude of 15,865 feet, a trifle
above that of Mont Blanc, is absolutely the highest railway
in the world. At Ticlio, the highest point of the main line,
is entered the Galera tunnel, three quarters of a mile long,
which cuts through the continental divide. The road then
descends to Oroya, altitude 12,178 feet. In taking the trip
for pleasure or business one not absolutely sure of the soundness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
of his heart should have it examined, or at least should
stop over two days at Matucana, 7788 feet, where there is a
fairly comfortable hotel. Any one is liable to suffer somewhat
from <i>soroche</i>, which may be avoided by the stop-over.
In general persons of good constitution, not too full blooded,
will be troubled only by a headache, perhaps accompanied by
nausea, and those who are careful to avoid rapid walking or
over exertion of any kind for a day or two after arrival above,
and who do not overeat before setting out on the journey or
afterwards may suffer no inconvenience whatever. No liquor
of any kind should be used except in collapse from heart failure.
Ammonia is desirable in case of headache.</p>

<p>From Oroya, terminus of the direct line, there are branches
to the north and south over the plateau. To reach the <i>montaña</i>
interior, which is more accessible here than from any other
point in Peru, one may go by automobile over another range
a thousand feet above, and beyond this, down, down, down
into the <i>montaña</i>. Tarma at 10,000 feet has a delightful climate,
and here are trees, perhaps the first seen in Peru, growing
as it were of their own accord. The picturesque cañon
below is lined with verdure, here and there are entrances
to side valleys. Tunnels and romantic swinging bridges formerly
lent variety to the ride. The new automobile road
opens up a rich and delightfully attractive country. La
Merced, altitude 3000 feet, is quite a little town with a pleasant
summer climate.</p>

<p>A short distance farther is the Perené, a coffee plantation,
at 2500 feet, belonging to the Peruvian Corporation.
The estate of 5,000,000 acres is not half cultivated, though
1¹⁄₂ million coffee trees had been planted in 1903. At this
altitude the country is still in the foothills of the Andes
with steep slopes on every hand, a narrow way only extending
along the river bank. The Perené is a considerable
stream easily navigable, an affluent of the Tambo, which
flows into the Ucayali; but the stream goes south a long
distance around, and through a region inhabited by savage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
Indians. It is therefore not used. The Chunchi Indians
living close by are fine looking people and friendly, sometimes
working on the plantation. This plantation is on the
main and mail route from Lima to Iquitos, capital of Loreto,
to which with good luck a journey may be made in 15 days.
Seven days are spent between Oroya and Puerto Jessup,
then one in canoe to Puerto Bermudez, and 5 or 6 in steam
launch to Iquitos, where a steamer may be taken to Manaos,
Pará, or New York.</p>

<p>A branch railway line, American owned, built by the
Cerro de Pasco Copper Company, extends north from Oroya
to Cerro de Pasco, about 90 miles over a hilly country, past
Lake Junín. Along the way many Quichua Indians are seen,
the chief population of the plateau region. Cerro de Pasco,
the terminus of the road from Oroya, is a town of 15,000
population at an altitude of 14,300 feet. A branch railway
leads to Goyllarisquisga, 26 miles, another to Quishuarcancha,
11 miles, to their coal properties.</p>

<p>Another branch or a continuation of the Central Railway
runs south on the plateau in the valley of the Jauja
River past a city of that name, population 3000, altitude
11,050 feet, a resort for consumptives for whom the coast
is too damp. Seventy-eight miles from Oroya at Huancayo,
population 6000, the road halted some years, but lately building
has recommenced and the road is probably open some
miles farther. Construction is proceeding in the direction
of Ayacucho to continue from there to Cuzco. By the time
this is accomplished a long stretch of the Pan American
Road will be completed, probably from the Callejón de
Huailas to Lake Titicaca, but the crossing of three cañons,
one 3000 feet deep, makes this an expensive job.</p>

<p><b>The Southern Railway of Peru</b>, also planned and partly
constructed by Henry Meiggs before he commenced the
Central, begins at the port of Mollendo; after a few miles
along the beach it climbs the high bluff on the side of projecting
buttresses, winding about till it reaches the edge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
of the desert plateau 3000 feet above. Then it proceeds on
the almost imperceptibly inclined desert, presently along
the edge of the Vitor Valley, 107 miles, to the beautifully
situated Arequipa, population 50,000, altitude 7550 feet.</p>

<p>The city is on the lower slope of El Misti, partly in the
valley of the Chili River which flows between Misti, 19,200
feet, and Chachani a little higher. Arequipa has a fine
cathedral, and cultured society, but poor hotels. A good one,
opened prematurely some years ago, unfortunately failed;
it would be a great success now. In the crater of Misti
are pure sulphur crystals, with some of which I once filled
my pocket; but other sources are more accessible. Much
business is transacted in the city, this being the centre of
commerce for Southern Peru, an immense district with
many towns and mining centres on and off the railroad.
At least one night must be spent here on the way up, and
several days are desirable both for business and to become
proof against <i>soroche</i>. The city is the site of the machine
shops for the railway, which with 526 miles of track is the
longest in the Republic. From Vitor between Mollendo and
Arequipa an automobile road is to be constructed to the Majes
Valley and Chuquibamba.</p>

<p>From Arequipa there are semi- or tri-weekly trains to
Cuzco and Puno. The road winds around the desert slopes
of Chachani to the higher land beyond. From the divide,
14,688 feet, the descent is gradual to Puno on the shore of
Lake Titicaca, 219 miles from Arequipa.</p>

<p>At Juliaca, 30 miles before Puno, the line branches north
towards Cuzco, 210 miles, a journey of a day and a half.
Sleeping cars run from Arequipa. The highest point on the
north division is 14,153 feet. Cuzco itself is at an altitude
of 11,445 feet. The place, almost surrounded by hills, has
a more genial climate than might be expected at this altitude.
The appearance of the country is very different from
that near Cerro de Pasco with more green and a milder
atmosphere. Cuzco is said once to have had a population<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
of 400,000, instead of the present 30,000. Some progress has
been made since railway connection was established in 1908;
a decent hotel, the Pullman, has superseded the apologies
for one then available. The population is chiefly Indian,
and many come in from the surrounding country to the
markets. The Department, a very rich but undeveloped
section, is on the border where Quichuas and Aymarás
mingle.</p>

<p>From the port of Puno, on the shore of Lake Titicaca,
altitude 12,500 feet, there is, in connection with the railway,
steamboat service (an all night journey) to Guaqui, at the
south end of the lake. Here is railroad connection for La
Paz, a three hours ride, all under the management of the
Peruvian Corporation, a British company which controls
also the Central Railway and most of the short lines from
the various ports; the Corporation has further among other
concessions one for the export of guano.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Proposed Railway Extension</span></h4>

<p>It is evident that the railways of this great country which
nowhere touch the vast <i>montaña</i> region and which leave destitute
most of the towns of the sierra district, are totally
inadequate for its development. However delightful the
climate or rich the country in agricultural or mineral resources,
few persons in the present age will settle in regions
remote from cities in time if not in distance, and where the
interchange of products is almost impossible for lack of
means of transportation. The leaders of the Government
are well aware of this fact and are doing their utmost to
promote railway development, both through their own
initiative and by their willingness to grant favorable terms
and, to some extent, guaranteed concessions to foreign capitalists.
The importance of connecting the coast and sierra
cities, and these with the Amazon Basin and river transportation
to the Atlantic is perfectly apparent. The ideal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
is for three or four railways serving different sections to extend
from coast ports up over the mountains down to the
navigable waters of the Amazon affluents, and that such
roads should be connected by a north and south line in the
sierra country as a part of the great Pan American system
long ago planned. Branches would diverge from all of these
lines, thus opening up large mineral deposits for operation,
and the rich agricultural lands of the <i>montaña</i> for settlement
and commerce.</p>

<p>For a long time several routes have been under discussion
and some concessions have been granted, which mismanagement
or the difficulty of getting capitalists to invest
in so remote a field have rendered abortive. Therefore there
is still discussion; and opportunities for construction are
open.</p>

<p>Beginning at the north the first cross line proposed is
that in the Department Piura, continuing the road from the
good port of Paita to Puerto Molendez, Calantura, or Limón,
on the Marañon River below the Pongo de Manserriche.
This plan has the great advantage of crossing the Andes
at its lowest point, 6600 feet. An important consideration
is that it would make practicable the export from Paita of
rubber which is now carried from Iquitos by way of the
Amazon and Pará; the far shorter journey by sea from
Paita to New York, easily made within ten days, would more
than counterbalance the rail freight from the river port
400 miles to Paita. It would surely be a better route for
business men and offers other advantages; among these
access to coal and iron mines en route.</p>

<p>Another transcontinental route proposed is from some
point connected with the Central Railway which has already
surmounted the divide. A route on which much money has
been spent for engineering investigation, surveys, and otherwise
is from Cerro de Pasco or Goyllarisquisga to Pucalpa
or some other point on the Ucayali. This central road for
political reasons seems extremely desirable. It would open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
up the fine grazing lands of the Pampa Sacramento, and
rich alluvial gold deposits in or on several streams, as well
as the forest and rubber country. Another suggestion is to
continue the road directly east from Oroya down to the
Perené River and to Puerto Wertheman; a better may be
to build 175 miles from Matahuasi, a station on the Oroya-Huancayo
Railway, to Jesus Marie on the Ené River near
the mouth of the Pangoa, where 12 feet of water would
permit of commerce by large steamers by way of the Tambo
and Ucayali.</p>

<p>One important cross route would naturally be by the
Southern Railway, from a point on the Cuzco branch, Tirapata,
Urcos, or Cuzco, the earlier plans looking to a connection
with the Madre de Dios River. But as this route
would necessitate a long roundabout journey, as well as a
passage through Bolivia and freightage on the Madeira-Mamoré
Railway, the Government has recently undertaken
for itself a line from Cuzco to Santa Ana on the Urubamba,
by which the journey is greatly shortened and will be wholly
within the Republic as far as Brazil, following down the
Urubamba and Ucayali to the Amazon and Iquitos. The
drawback to this route is that only very light draught
steamers can come up to Santa Ana at any season of the
year.</p>

<p>Lines quoted as under construction by the Peruvian
Government in 1919 are that from Chimbote up the Huailas
Valley to Recuay, already referred to, which when completed
will be immediately profitable, the continuation of the road
from Huancayo to Cuzco, now open 30 miles from the
former city; and the Cuzco to Santa Ana just mentioned.
A short line recently opened from Lima to Lurín, crossing
the Pachacamac River, brings two fertile valleys with their
fruit and vegetables into close connection with the capital.
Lurín is but 16 miles from the suburb Chorillos, which for
some years has had railway service. The ancient pre-Inca
ruins at Pachacamac are now easily accessible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>The Longitudinal or Pan American Railway, crossing all
the others, would come in at the north from Cuenca and
Loja in Ecuador, continuing to Huancabamba, Jaen, and
Cajamarca in that Department, thence down the valley to
the Santa River, there joining the railway to Recuay, which
will be prolonged to Goyllarisquisga. By this time the connection
will be complete to Cuzco, and so to La Paz, La
Quiaca, and Buenos Aires.</p>

</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Agriculture</span></h4>

<p>While for centuries Peru has been celebrated as a land
of marvelous mineral riches, especially of gold and silver,
nevertheless, in spite of her desert shore, her bleak table-land,
and her undeveloped montaña, like California, her
chief wealth is in her agriculture. What the figures say
about the exports is easily ascertainable; but though corroborating
this statement they do not tell all the story,
since most of the mineral production is exported, while the
greater part of the agricultural stays at home. Of the latter,
sugar is the leading product.</p>

<p><b>Sugar</b> grows along the coast and, where opportunity
offers, up to a height of 4500 feet; in the montaña to a height
of 6000 feet. At present most of it is raised near the coast.
The Chicama Valley, famed for its splendid estates, produces
more sugar than the entire Island of Porto Rico, and
this of the finest quality. In the temperate, equable climate,
the cane matures early and may be cut all the year around.
It is unusually rich in sucrose. Some estates are 15-20
miles square, producing 15,000-30,000 tons each; 50-60 tons
of cane to the acre is quite usual. The cane is cut and
ground from 18 to 24 months after planting, and being cut
throughout the year instead of during four or five months
only, the same amount of work may be done with far less
machinery and fewer laborers. In places a two months
suspension is made, when the river is full, to attend to irrigation
and to clean or repair machinery, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>The cane has more than 14 per cent sucrose, often 16
or 17 per cent. The returns have nowhere been surpassed;
the production to the acre is double that of Cuba, where the
average is 23-24 tons, in Peru 45-50 tons. At Cartavio, an
estate of 29,000 acres in the Chicama Valley, they once cut
79.8 long tons of cane per acre from a field of 85 acres.
This had 15.24 per cent sucrose and gave 12 tons of sugar
an acre, a probable record. The grinding capacity is 1000
metric tons in 23 hours. In 1917 they ground 240,000 tons
making 34,000 tons of sugar, mostly white granulated. The
Casa Grande in the same valley, said to be the largest estate
in the world, has a population of 11,000. Churches, schools,
hospitals, and “movies” are provided for the work people,
and the luxuries of modern life for owners and superintendents.
In the montaña sugar cane is said to grow to a
height of 30 feet and once planted to persist for a century.
One writer speaks of two or three crops from one planting,
but nine years without replanting is not unusual on the
coast.</p>

<p>In the year 1915-16, 100,000 tons were exported from
Salaverry, more the year following; half as much from the
smaller port of Huanchaco near by. Production in Peru
reached 400,000 tons in 1918. The plantation Tambo Real,
on the Santa River near Chimbote, was recently sold for
$1,750,000. Just back of the port is plenty of good sugar
land, now desert but easily irrigable. As the nitrates have
never been washed out of the land by rain, the soil is of
extraordinary fertility; with irrigation the cane receives
the precise amount of water required and at the right season.
Back of Samanco are two large sugar estates, one belonging
to the British Sugar Company, which has a larger at Cañete
in the south, producing long ago 30,000 tons a year. One
estate had years ago 22 miles of tramway which was to be
increased. In some places small farmers owning or renting
land sell their cane to sugar mills. Most of the estates
have the best of machinery. In 1911 $100,000 worth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
sugar machinery was imported into one Department, Lambayeque.
Labor is cheaper than in Cuba, formerly 60 cents
a day, but with housing and other perquisites. Much sugar
has been exported to Chile; recently to Europe and the
United States. Some years ago sugar could be sold at a
port at a profit for 1.5 cents a pound, more recently at 2.5
cents. There is still a field for investment in desert land,
suitable for those with sufficient capital to arrange for irrigation.
About 600,000 acres are now devoted to sugar.</p>

<p><b>Cotton.</b> Native to the country is cotton, and Peru has
its own special variety, <i>Gossypium Peruvianum</i>. It is so soft
and fine that it is called vegetable wool, and it is much
used for weaving underwear, stockings, etc., with wool,
which it even improves, as the cloth is less liable to shrinkage
than all wool. This variety grows to a height of 10-16
feet, giving a first small crop in eight months, but not reaching
its best until the sixth year. It holds out well through
drought, requiring but one irrigation yearly. The trees are
planted 15 feet apart, the interspace being occupied with
vegetables and corn. No ploughing is necessary and two
crops a year are obtained. With the names full rough and
moderate rough it is mixed with wool for textile manufacture.
Piura is its special habitat, but it grows well in Ica
at the south.</p>

<p>The Egyptian, the Sea Island, or the ordinary American
are preferred by some growers on account of their earlier
development. The Egyptian is cultivated in Ica from the
shore to 60 miles inland, also in Lima; the Sea Island and
the Peruvian Mitafifi, similar to the Egyptian, near Huacho
and Supe; the smooth cotton from ordinary American seed
anywhere. The Egyptian, also called Upland, grows to about
four feet, yielding two or three years, beginning six months
after sowing. It needs several waterings, but has an advantage
in being free from weevil blight. This and the
ordinary American are the most popular varieties. Peru is
twelfth among world producers, needing only more irrigated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
land for greatly increased production. There is water
enough but labor and capital have been wanting. All conditions
are favorable as in Egypt. The length of the various
cotton fibres is given as: Sea Island, 1.61 inches; Egyptian,
1.41; Peruvian, 1.30; Brazilian, 1.17; American upland, 1.02;
Indian, 0.8.</p>

<p><b>Coffee.</b> An important product is coffee, the best said
to be grown in the sierra region; but the finest I ever drank
was raised on a small plantation back of Samanco, where
it was roasted, ground, and made within the hour, of course
pulverized and dripped as universally in South America.
In the deep valleys at the east also, excellent coffee is grown:
in Puno, in the Chanchamayo and the Perené valleys, called
the <i>montaña</i> by the sierra people, in Huánuco farther north,
in the Paucartambo valley of Cuzco south, as well as in the
Pacasmayo and other coast sections. Five hundred plants are
set to the acre, 800 in the Perené, which produce each 2 pounds
annually. Even with a low price for coffee its production is
profitable there, in spite of the one time $60 a ton freight rate
to Callao; large profits are made at good prices. After supplying
home consumption there is a considerable export.</p>

<p><b>Cacao.</b> The production of cacao, which grows wild in
the <i>montaña</i>, should be greatly increased. The Department
of Cuzco produces a particularly fine article with exquisite taste
and aroma, which brings a higher price than that of Brazil
or Ecuador, though little known outside of the country. In the
Perené Valley a plantation of 200,000 trees has been set out.
Vast tracts in the Departments of Amazonas and San Martín
and in the Province of Jaen are also suited to its growth.</p>

<p><b>Coca.</b> The culture of coca is important, but more limited
as to future development since its medicinal use should not
be greatly increased and its general use not at all. The plant
is a shrub, usually six feet high, cultivated in the districts
of Otuzco (the most important) and Huamachuco (Libertad),
Huanta (Ayacucho), Cuzco, and Huánuco. It grows best in
valleys of 3000 to 7000 feet altitude, where the temperature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
varies from 60° to 85°, in clayey but not marshy ground,
with iron but no salt. It needs frequent rains and humidity.
Three or four crops may be picked annually, the first in 18
months; the yield continues 40 years. Care is needed in
picking the leaves and in drying. A great quantity is consumed
by the Indians, and some is exported to Europe and
the United States, both as dried leaves for making wines,
tonics, etc., and for the extraction of alkaloid; also as cocaine
for the making of which over 20 small factories exist in
Peru. Chewing coca leaves is of great service on the plateau
for necessary and unusual exertion, but injurious and stupefying
when its use is continuous.</p>

<p><b>Rice</b> is grown in the north in Lambayeque and in the
Pacasmayo Valley of Libertad. With one flooding and
little ploughing the crops are produced annually, 46,000 tons
in 1917. A little is exported but more is imported. The
two varieties grown are Carolina and Jamaica. The straw
is not utilized.</p>

<p><b>Fruits</b> of various kinds may be grown in all the coast
valleys, but south of Lima the culture, especially of grapes,
is more advanced. Even in poor years it is said that the
grape crop is superior to the European average; but too
little attention has been paid to improving and extending the
industry. The vineyards are small and combined with the
other interests of a <i>hacienda</i>. The grapes are grown on stocks
about eight feet apart, supported first by canes, later by trellises
on adobe columns. Nine hundred gallons of wine an acre
is an average yield. Italia and Abilla are cultivated for white
wines, Quebranta, Moscatel, and others for red; the former of
these two being most prolific and generally grown. A pink
Italia is a fine table fruit. Wines cheap and good are manufactured
to the amount of 2,200,000 gallons yearly, and 770,000
gallons of <i>pisco</i>, made from white grapes, also quantities of
alcohol. The sugar of the <i>montaña</i> is used to make <i>aguardiente</i>
or rum; in several coast districts a finer quality is made from
grapes and is probably what in some sections is called <i>pisco</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>Peru is rich in the variety of fruit possibilities, but
grapes and olives are the only ones cultivated in a large
way, with a view to commercial profit. Olives grown in the
south from imported trees are said to excel those of Spain
or California. About 70,000 pounds are exported. The yield
of oil is about 30 per cent; not enough is made for home
consumption. Large possibilities exist in this direction.
Other fruits grown are of course oranges, bananas, melons,
pomegranates, <i>paltas</i>, or <i>aguacates</i>, or as we call them, alligator
pears, fine as properly eaten, the half fruit with salad dressing
inside; <i>chirimoias</i>, when in perfection nothing better; strawberries
nearly all the year around at Lima, more like the wild
fruit with delicate flavor; prickly pears, peanuts, pears, cherries,
etc.</p>

<p><b>Vegetables</b> in great variety are raised, some like ours,
others never before met with. Potatoes in many varieties
grow up to an altitude of 13,000 feet or more. The wild
bitter tuber from which the varieties were probably developed
still grows wild. Enock says the yellow potato
(not sweet) is unrivalled for excellence, but I saw none
superior to the best of our white. Other tubers cultivated
are the yam (three crops a year), <i>manioc</i>, and others.</p>

<p><b>Maize.</b> The best maize in the world, says Vivian, is
grown in Peru; but I am sure that he never ate any sweet
corn in Rhode Island. Grown in all parts of the country
up to 11,500 feet, it is native, like potatoes and cotton, and
is one of the main stays of the country. Maize and potatoes
are the chief foods of the Indians. Parched corn is much
eaten on the plateau; it is most useful where bread is not to
be had, and often is to be preferred. Toasted maize is called
<i>cancha</i>. Three, sometimes four, crops are had annually. Food
for man and beast, the stalks used for fodder, it is all consumed
in the country. That grown near Cuzco is said to
be of the finest quality, with grains the size of large beans,
a very thin pellicle, and very farinaceous. One district in
Lima produces 10,000 tons a year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p><b>Cereals</b> are raised, wheat, barley, and oats, from 5000
to 11,500 feet. Wheat formerly grown on the coast is now
seen on the uplands, but large importations of wheat and
flour are made. Barley grows to a greater height, 12,000
feet or more and is much used for animal fodder, for mules
and horses, taking the place of oats, which are not much
cultivated. Alfalfa, much better for fodder than barley, is
largely used, growing in sheltered places up to 12,000 feet,
about the same as maize. A specialty of Peru and Bolivia
is <i>quinua</i>, which is very prolific and grows freely in poor soil
from 9000 up to 13,500 feet. It would be well if it were widely
cultivated in other countries. Suitable conditions could be
found in many places not necessarily at such altitudes. For
many purposes it seems preferable to corn meal. It may be
eaten raw with sugar or water or cooked as mush; it is called
a tonic for <i>soroche</i>. The grains are round, about the size of
mustard seed.</p>

<p><b>Tobacco</b> is raised to a small extent, especially in Tumbes
and adjoining districts. It is called of superior quality, and
is preferred by some Peruvians to the imported, but it is
too strong and coarse for many; the upper class Peruvians
generally prefer Havanas. Perhaps 1000 tons are produced,
some of which is exported to Bolivia, Chile, and Brazil. The
Government has a monopoly of its sale, regulating price and
profits of native and imported both, and owning the cigarette
factories.</p>

<p>Ramie grass and haricot beans produce each four crops
a year, flax and hemp, two crops; the castor oil plant is
cultivated, and at the south the mulberry with the silk-worm.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Forestry</span></h4>

<p>Forest products except rubber have received little attention,
although the export of tagua, vegetable ivory, has greatly increased
within the last ten years. The palm grows wild in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
<i>montaña</i>. The nuts are picked up by the Indians and carried
to Iquitos, thence sent to Europe. They are also used in the
forest for curing rubber, the only industry of much importance
in this section.</p>

<p><b>Rubber</b> for years has been exported in considerable
quantities, at first collected from districts on the tributaries
of the Marañon, later from those of the Ucayali. Earlier the
rubber gatherers called <i>caucheros</i> cut down the <i>caucho</i> trees,
a hole in the ground having been previously prepared to receive
the milk, which was then coagulated by a solution of soap
with the juice of a native plant called <i>vetilla</i>. This method of
cutting down the trees, which still has some vogue in other
countries, is now forbidden in Peru. The <i>caucho</i> here averages
100 pounds to a tree. It was exported in planks or cakes
weighing 80 to 100 pounds each. The <i>jebe</i>, rubber of the finest
quality passing for the best Pará fine, comes from the <i>hevea
brasiliensis</i> or other species of <i>hevea</i>. These trees are found
lower down than the <i>castilloa elastica</i> (from which comes the
<i>caucho</i>) at an altitude of about 300 feet, where it grows to a
height of 60 to 70 feet. By tapping the <i>hevea</i>, about 20 pounds
yearly of rubber is obtained. Peru’s rubber export 1908-12
averaged 4¹⁄₂-5¹⁄₂ million pounds worth 20 to 30 million dollars;
but the lowering of price due to the Ceylon plantations, and
perhaps the discovery of atrocities practiced upon the Indians
in some quarters greatly diminished the export for some years.
It seems to be reviving. In 1916 $3,400,000 worth was exported.
Better regulations have been made and the possibility
of arranging a system of plantations is discussed. Nearly all
the rubber is exported from Iquitos; but some from the Madre
de Dios section, the Inambari, and the Urubamba goes out by
way of Mollendo. The export duty of Peru, 8 per cent, has
been much less than that of Brazil.</p>

<p>Other forest products, which now receive little attention,
include all kinds of valuable timbers, medicinal plants, dye
woods, etc., usual in a tropical forest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Stock Raising</span></h4>

<p><b>Cattle.</b> The cattle industry is one of large importance,
pasturage beginning in the foot-hills of the coast, and going up
to 13,000 feet or more. The large ranches are in the sierra,
some having 20,000 cattle and 500,000 sheep. Cattle are raised
in Cajamarca, Junín, Ayacucho, Cuzco, and Puno. The beef
is apt to be tough, badly cut, and is better boiled than
roasted. Cross breeding with Argentine or other stock
would improve it greatly, and attention is being paid to the
matter. The pasture lands are called excellent. Hides are
quite largely exported and cattle are imported from Argentina
and Chile, chiefly for slaughter, a few for stock. Mutton
is largely eaten in the sierra.</p>

<p><b>Wool</b> is an important export, likely to increase, for the
plateau affords ample space, with good wild grasses. The
native sheep have rather long legs and a rough scanty
fleece; crossed with merinos they give more wool. Good
stock was brought from Punta Arenas some years ago with
an experienced manager, and near Lake Junín a big ranch
has been developing on 130 square miles. There is no finer
country for sheep raising than the high valleys of the
plateau. Alpacas, <i>vicuñas</i> and llamas also afford wool, the
first two of much greater value. The <i>vicuña</i> wool is the finest,
but there are so few of the animals that the export is small.
That of alpaca, however, is greater than that of wool, at least
in value. The larger part of the world’s supply of the genuine
article comes from the Peruvian and Bolivian plateau. The
llama, the great burden bearer, has a heavy but coarse fleece,
yet some of it is exported. There are more of these three
animals in Bolivia. The Indians are expert in their care. The
<i>guanaco</i> is a larger animal, somewhat similar, which has never
been domesticated, and is hunted by the Indians for food.
The chinchilla, and the <i>viscacha</i>, the Peruvian hare, are hunted
for their skins. Many pigs are raised and lard is exported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p><b>Horses.</b> The horses are rather small, but are very fine
saddle animals. Some have five distinct gaits. I found
them more sure-footed than mules, going up and down
veritable rock stairways with ease. They are to some extent
originally of Arabian stock.</p>

<p><b>Fish</b> of the finest quality of 40 or more varieties and in
great abundance are found off the coast; large lobsters,
scallops, the corbina, cod, sole, smelt, mackerel, and many
others are caught.</p>

<p><b>Guano.</b> There are seals on the islands and an enormous
number of sea-birds, which have made the great deposits
of guano on the islands. As there was no rain the deposits
have been preserved for centuries without loss of the nitrogen
of which there is 14 per cent. The islands occur singly
or in groups along the coast, some far out beyond the track
of the steamers. All are barren and uninhabited. The
Chincha Islands had enormous deposits now exhausted.
There has been much waste, and deposits have been removed
so ruthlessly as to disturb the birds; but now there are
careful regulations. Agreement was made some years ago
with the Peruvian Corporation (British) by which they
were allotted 2,000,000 tons of the guano; of this they have
had more than half; operations have recently been restricted
and few shipments made.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Mining</span></h4>

<p>The mine fields of Peru, once famous for their production
of gold and silver, never wholly neglected, were for a
time less vigorously worked. In the days of the Spanish
colonists gold and silver were the chief objects of acquisition,
but lately these metals have seemed less fashionable
than copper. The variety in Peru’s wealth in minerals is
shown to some extent by a list of her production in 1917
in millions of pounds in round numbers: copper, 84; copper
matte, 4.4; copper ore, 16.5; vanadium, 7; lead ore, 7.5;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
antimony ore, 3.75; silver ore, 1.76; tungsten, 1. Smaller
quantities of other ores were produced: gold, 2000 pounds;
sulphur, 120,000; metallic silver, 8000; silver concentrates,
700,000; precipitated silver, 10,000; lead bullion, 250,000;
lead concentrates, 650,000; zinc ores, 640,000; lead slag,
177,000; copper cement, 145,000; molybdenum, 12,000; gold
ores, 30,500. Many other minerals exist, not exported in
large enough quantities to have been given in this list.</p>

<p><b>Copper.</b> Americans were slow to become interested in
mining investments in South America as in commercial
trade, but when assured of the success of the pioneer enterprise
inaugurated at Cerro de Pasco by New York capitalists
about 1900, others followed, and large sums have now
been invested in several Republics. Silver was discovered
at Cerro de Pasco in 1630 and $200,000,000 were produced
in one century. Four hundred and fifty million ounces were
obtained by hand labor, the ore being carried by llamas to
primitive smelters. Little interest was taken in copper;
only ore with 25-50 per cent of the metal was formerly
exported. Here at Cerro, where is located, some say, the
richest copper deposit in the world, the titanic forces of
nature cast upward a wonderful mass of material, gold,
silver, copper, etc. Here are great open pits several hundred
feet deep, worked for centuries for silver.</p>

<p>The Cerro de Pasco Company has spent about $30,000,000
in acquiring properties here and at Morococha, in constructing
smelters, railways, buildings for employees, and
in developing the properties, from which handsome returns
are now obtained. The property of the Cerro de Pasco
Mining Company consists of 730 mining claims and 108
coal mining claims. The reserves exceed 3,000,000 tons of
copper ore, one estimate is 75,000,000. Nearly every claim
carries ore with gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, and cobalt.
High silver values exist to 100 feet deep, sometimes running
to thousands of ounces a ton, deeper are silver copper
ores, and lower still little silver and more copper. The old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
open mines are 100-300 feet deep. The mines are very wet,
especially below 400 feet. A drainage canal begun by
Meiggs in 1877 was completed in 1907. The new workings
include five shafts and two tunnels of two miles each. The
shafts have openings at four levels, the bottom 410 feet.
Waste is used for filling, as timber is dear. The smelter
has five blast furnaces, each running 300 tons daily. A converter
is in another building. A hydro-electric plant completed
in 1913 cost $1,000,000. There is a 10 mile ditch and
pipe line with one 750 foot fall and a second of 200 feet.
The transmission line, 70 miles, serves Morococha and Pasco.
There is a coke plant near the smelter and a brick plant
of great value. The coal mines are at Goyllarisquisga and
Quishuarcancha, 21 and 11 miles respectively. The coal is
not very good, averaging 35 per cent carbon, but answers
the purpose.</p>

<p>The Corporation owns 12 mines at Morococha and rents
others. The deepest shaft is 750 feet. Several drainage
tunnels are required. The production, 12,000 tons a month,
was expected to be increased to 16,000. The ore of the several
mines runs 5, 14, 15, and in one mine 20 per cent copper
continuously, the 14 per cent with 14-70 ounces of silver
per ton. The ore averages 7 per cent copper and 10 ounces
silver. The mines have produced 20,000,000 pounds of copper
a year, one third of the de Pasco Company’s output.
Morococha is ten miles from Ticlio, the highest point on the
main line of the Central Railway; the ore is sent to a smelter
at Casapalca, altitude 13,600 feet, ten miles farther down.</p>

<p>The property at Casapalca also is controlled by the Cerro
de Pasco Company. In one mine there, a 5000 foot adit
cuts the vein 2500 feet below the outcrop; other adits are
higher. The ore is sent to the smelter by an aerial tram.
The output is 2500 tons a month, two per cent copper, and
40 ounces silver. The Casapalca smelter has three blast
furnaces and four barrel type converters. The flue dust is
briquetted and returned. It does custom work for independent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
miners, and in 1916 treated 175,000 dry tons, producing
nearly 20,000,000 pounds of fine copper, 3,000,000
ounces of silver, and 3587 of gold; the capacity is now increased
50 per cent. A new smelter has been erected at
Yauli by the Company. The Cerro de Pasco property is
said to be the most costly ever developed; the ores are refractory.
With the cost production eight cents a pound
on an output of over 70,000,000 tons a year, $4.20 a share
is earned on 14 cent copper, double on 20 cent copper. The
Corporation’s income in 1916 was $3,676,000, about 12 per
cent on the investment; about 8 per cent was paid in dividends,
not an undue amount on what was considered by
many a very large risk.</p>

<p>Another great copper property, also owned by Americans,
is at Yauricocha, about 50 miles south of Yauli, and
west of the Oroya-Huancayo Railway. Four hundred and
fifty thousand tons averaging 16 per cent copper and 2¹⁄₂
ounces of silver per ton, five per cent of the probable ore
in sight, are now ready for stoping. The smelter and blast
furnace have an output of 15-18 tons of blister copper daily.
Native labor of fair quality may be obtained at one fifth of
the cost in the United States, while the ore is said to be
six times as rich as most of that in the West. Considerable
water power is available. An automobile road has been
constructed from the station Pachacayo 60 miles to the mine.</p>

<p>There are other rich copper deposits in Peru, in Huancavelica,
Cuzco, Arequipa, Ica, Apurimac, Junín, Ancash,
Cajamarca; but as yet none of them is in full production.
Ferrobamba in the Department of Cuzco, 45 miles west of
the city, at an altitude of 13,000 feet, is one of the largest
properties, with 207 claims over 225 acres. The concession
includes water rights; 120,000 horse power is available. The
ore can be worked by steam shovels. One field is estimated
to contain 12,000,000 tons of ore, 6 per cent copper, 3 ounces
silver and 9 grams gold. Its inaccessibility has so far prevented
extensive operations. The Anaconda Copper Company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
owns a copper property in the Department of Arequipa.
Copper matte is exported from Queruvilca, Otuzco,
Santiago de Chuco, and Cajabamba.</p>

<p><b>Coal</b>, contrary to earlier supposition, is now known to
be widespread in Peru. The astonishing figures of 6¹⁄₄
billion tons have recently been given as the estimated supply,
over 4 billion of these in Tumbes, a quantity hitherto
unsuspected, perhaps unverified. However, coal deposits
are certainly scattered along the great Andes Range and in
the foothills, mainly in the central and northern sections.
Within 100 miles of the coast are millions of tons of anthracite
coal near Cupisnique and Huayday; millions more back
of Chimbote and along the Huailas Valley, anthracite, semi-anthracite,
and bituminous with many veins 4¹⁄₂-13 feet
thick. Higher in the plateau region are deposits of soft
coal near Oyón, Cerro de Pasco, and at Jatunhuasi. The
de Pasco coal, 35 per cent carbon, must be washed before
coking in the smelter. Forty per cent of the material is
rejected. The best coal is used on the Railway. It costs
$2.92 at the mine. The Company has no more than is
needed for their smelters and railway. Better coal is found
at Jatunhuasi 30 miles from Pachacayo, on the road to the
copper mines at Yauricocha, the same company owning
both. This coal, 45 per cent carbon, makes better coke
which now sells at $25 a ton at Pachacayo, previously at
$40. This deposit, estimated at 40,000,000 tons, is said to
be the largest known in Peru of high grade coking coal, and
the only one capable of large scale mining without pumping.</p>

<p>At Paracas in the Department of Ica are veins near the
sea. Capital for working the coal mines has not hitherto
been available; and land transport a few miles by llamas has
been more expensive than carriage by sea a few thousand.
The need is imperative; and foreign capitalists should
and no doubt soon will aid in the development of these rich
resources. The annual production is now estimated as
400,000 tons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p><b>Gold</b> and silver are always interesting, and there is still
plenty in Peru. In 1916 about $1,200,000 worth of gold was
mined, though accurate statistics are impossible, on account
of the difficulty of estimating the quantity got out by the
Indians. A Peruvian engineer estimates the product from
the Inambari River through their primitive methods as
$100,000 yearly. They build a floor in the river, and the
next season wash out the gold sand in the crevices. There
are auriferous deposits in Puno and Cuzco; both veins and
placers at Sandia and Carabaya, and at Quispicanchis and
Paucartambo. Gold coinage in 1918 amounted to nearly
$3,000,000. The Aporama Goldfields property near the
Hauri Hauri River at Sandia, Puno, has placer deposits
covering 1277 acres. It was just reaching production stage
when the War opened and interfered. The New Chuquitambo
Company has 142 acres in the Cerro de Pasco Province.
The Inca Mining Company, American, has the Santo
Domingo Mines on the Inambari River, now in the Madre
de Dios Department. From Tirapata on the Juliaca-Cuzco
Railway, there is a wagon road for some miles, then a
mule trail over the Aricoma Pass, 16,500 feet, and down to
an altitude of 7000 feet. Even with the difficulties attending
the transportation of machinery and supplies $8,000,000 have
been produced without exhausting the deposit. The Cochasayhuas
mine in Cotabambas yields $20,000 a month.
Seventy per cent of the gold production is said to come from
Puno.</p>

<p><b>Silver.</b> Of silver mines the most important is reported
to be that of the Anglo-French Company near the port of
Huarmey. Dividends have averaged from 20 to 25 per
cent per annum. Possibly rivalling this, are mines farther
south at an altitude up to 16,500 feet, the reduction works
at 15,200 feet in the Cerro Quespesisa, 120 miles back of
Pisco. Less favorably located, but one of the most productive
districts in Peru, in the last 50 years it has yielded
6,000,000 ounces of silver with crude processes and a loss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
of over 25 per cent. The fuel used is <i>taquia</i> (llama dung) of
which 1500 tons a year are burned. The temperature in the
middle of the day is 45°. At that altitude there is no great
difference in the seasons in the torrid zone. Supplies are
brought from Pisco, a four and a half days’ journey.</p>

<p>The Morococha mines produced in 1916 (estimated)
1,500,000 ounces. The selected ore sent from Colquipocro
to a Liverpool smelter averaged for some years $200 a ton,
while the thousands of tons on the dump run $80 a ton.
Silver is usually found with either copper or lead, in Peru
oftener with the latter, while gold is in veins of ferruginous
quartz, generally with other metals as silver and copper,
as well as in sand, alluvial deposits, and in nuggets. Other
silver mines operated are in Cajamarca, Ancash, at Yauli
near Oroya, at Cailloma in Arequipa 100 miles north of
Sumbay, and elsewhere.</p>

<p><b>Vanadium</b> is found near Cerro de Pasco, the property of
Americans. From 70 to 80 per cent of the world’s supply
is believed to be in Peru, the second largest stock in Colorado.
It is of great value for certain purposes in steel construction.
The Peruvian ore, roasted before shipping, contains
25 per cent of vanadium. Three thousand five hundred
tons were exported in 1918.</p>

<p><b>Quicksilver.</b> In the old mines of Huancavelica there is
resumption of work through the activity of Señor Fernandini,
a prominent Peruvian mine owner who has a smelter
near that of Cerro de Pasco. He has been clearing out old
tunnels, and driving new ones across, to cut the ores 700
feet below the old surface workings. A hydro-electric plant
is on trial for the furnaces. The mines are high on the
mountain above the town Huancavelica. The ore is a bright
red cinnabar, mercury sulphide, impregnating clean sandstone
uniformly, or along planes or fractures.</p>

<p><b>Other minerals</b> exported are tungsten, in 1917 1500 tons
with a 60 per cent basis; a deposit at Yauli gives 14 per
cent zinc with silver; a large borax lake near the city of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
Arequipa is likely soon to be developed; salt, a government
monopoly, is found in many places but mainly worked in
the <i>salinas</i> of Huacho near Lima. Bismuth, molybdenum, and
antimony are found.</p>

<p><b>Petroleum</b> is a very important product of Peru, the total
area of oil territory being 5000 square miles, not all proved
but with possibilities. The chief field is in Tumbes and
Piura in the north, the Titicaca so far having made slight
production. The latter field is 300 miles from the sea and
eight from Lake Titicaca, near the Bolivian frontier and
extending toward Cuzco. Deposits have been found in several
provinces but the chief work was not far from the
Juliaca station where 10 wells were sunk, in 1912 producing
an average of 50 barrels a day, the oil with the paraffin
base. At last accounts the work had been discontinued.
In 1915 there were 524 wells in the country.</p>

<p>The field at the north extends 180 miles south from the
town of Tumbes to some distance beyond Paita, running
east to the mountains and perhaps including the Islands of
Lobos. The field is 30 miles wide, though some believe it
may extend 150 miles. Here is practically no rain, no vegetation,
and no water, except that of the sea which is used
for all purposes. The temperature is called ideal. The
wells range from 250 to over 3000 feet deep. At the north
there is a slight plateau 160-500 feet high, running down
towards the south.</p>

<p>The Zorritos field farthest north and the oldest in Peru
is 24 miles south of Tumbes, with wells four miles along
the coast, drilled mostly at the water’s edge and some in the
ocean. The deepest is 3000 feet but most are 600-2000 feet.
Some wells produce 500-600 barrels a day, but one third of
those dug were failures.</p>

<p>The Lobitos field in Piura, 60 miles north of Paita, with
a proved area of 725 square miles the second largest in Peru,
has all its wells over 2000 feet deep. One sunk to 3435 feet
was a failure. A well around 3000 feet deep costs $10 per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
foot average, against $1.50 or $2.00 for wells under 1500
feet. The shallower wells here are short lived. In 1915
a new pool was opened 12 miles north.</p>

<p>The Negritos field is the richest, 40 miles north of Paita,
with an area of 650 square miles. The average depth of
the wells is 2500-3000 feet and the most important oil deposits
are below 1500 feet. Eleven miles east is an asphalt
seepage called La Brea. The oil from Negritos is piped
16 miles north to Talara, the port where the refinery and
the wharves are situated. Besides the 6-inch pipe line there
is a narrow gauge railway. The modern refinery has a
capacity of 6000 barrels a day. With pressure stills employed
the oil will give 75 per cent benzine. The Talara
port permits vessels of 28-foot draught to approach the
wharves. The International Petroleum Company, said to
be controlled by Standard Oil interests, now operates this
property and has taken over the smaller property of the
Lagunitos Oil Company 11 miles from Talara. The amount
of oil production in Peru has in ten years increased from
756,226 barrels of 42 gallons to 2,550,000 barrels in 1916,
two thirds of the last amount coming from Negritos and
Lagunitos.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Industries</span></h4>

<p>While Peru does not support large manufacturing industries
she has more than some other South American countries
and ample means for increase. Scattered along the
coast are more than 50 streams which, though small, falling
10,000 feet, are capable of providing an immense amount
of electric power. The use of electricity is already widespread,
electric lights and telephones are found in many
towns, in several, electric cars; the development of this
source of power is progressing.</p>

<p>Of factories, sugar mills take the lead, 50 <i>haciendas</i> near
the coast having their own mills. In some of these 75 per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
cent of the sucrose is extracted with the use of the best
machinery. Alcohol and <i>aguardiente</i> are made from both sugar
cane and grapes, as well as wine from the latter. There are
rice mills, and factories for making soap, tallow, lard,
matches, chocolate, paper, and other ordinary articles; tobacco,
cigar and cigarette factories, flour mills, etc. Panamá
hats, though made by hand, must not be forgotten.</p>

<p>Of great importance is the manufacture of textiles, in
which the Indians were so proficient in Inca days that their
work is said never to have been surpassed. Now there are
seven cotton factories, five of these at Lima, making 24,000,000
yards of cloth for the home market. Three thousand
operatives are employed. Also there are five woolen
factories, at Lima, Cuzco, and Arequipa. Although the
Indians are illiterate and lacking in initiative they have a
taste for mechanics as well as for agriculture and pastoral
pursuits. They still weave and spin, making excellent ponchos
and blankets. Education will be a developer. The
Indian’s patience and skill should be utilized, his ambition
roused, so that he may desire to live more comfortably.
Higher wages and more varied wants for these people will
produce more business and prosperity in all lines.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Investments</span></h4>

<p>Peru obviously offers very favorable opportunities in
many lines: railway construction and varied works of engineering,
irrigation, sanitation, development of electric
power; agriculture, especially the raising of sugar and cotton
along the coast, and of a variety of additional products
in the montaña; mining of all kinds, especially coal; stock
raising; all of these in many sections with a very desirable
climate. Of stock, the raising of sheep for the export of
wool would doubtless be most profitable. The grasses of
the table-land are excellent fodder; the climate is cold
enough to ensure heavy fleece but not so extreme as to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
injurious in snow storms or in fair weather. By importing
a few rams an expert in the business would be able to conduct
it with large profit.</p>

<p>The farmer may purchase land in the montaña at $1.00
an acre and up, according to location, or secure it on other
terms arranged for immigrants. Rubber and timber lands
are leased under special regulations. Fruit raising and
poultry might be profitable in some places. There is an
excellent chance for small factories, perhaps for large ones.
In many cities of the North and West Coasts American
hotels or boarding houses, if properly conducted, would have
great success.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br><span class="small">BOLIVIA: AREA, HISTORY, GOVERNMENT,
POPULATION, ETC.</span></h3>
</div>


<p>One of the two inland Republics of South America,
Bolivia has an enormous area, a section of which is still
unexplored in detail. Its chief towns situated on the lofty
Andean plateau or a little over its eastern edge, it seems
wonderful indeed that here in the 16th century, prior to
the existence of New York or Boston, were populous,
wealthy cities, hundreds of miles from the coast and from
the seat of the Viceroy at Lima. In the present day, such
a horseback ride across country as was then and till within
a half century common, would by most persons be considered
quite a feat, while a similar descent to the Atlantic
port of Buenos Aires, then not unusual, is an expedition
that would commend itself to few; though this crossing were
to the Paraguay River only, where a steamboat would be
available for the remainder of the journey.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Area, Population, Boundary</span></h4>

<p><b>Area.</b> Bolivia, with an area variously given as 515,000
to 708,000 square miles, is generally counted third in size
of the Republics. Pending the settlement of the boundary
dispute with Paraguay and more accurate surveys, probably
at least 600,000 may be conceded, a larger territory than the
entire Atlantic slope of the United States. Once possessing
a small coast line which included the port of Antofagasta,
Bolivia was deprived of this in 1883 at the close of the
war with Chile.</p>

<p><b>Population.</b> The number of inhabitants, mainly an estimate,
has been recently given as nearly 3,000,000. With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
about four persons to a square mile, it is the most sparsely
peopled of American Republics.</p>

<p><b>Boundary.</b> At the north and east the country borders
on Brazil. Paraguay is at the southeast, Argentina directly
south, and Chile and Peru west.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">History</span></h4>

<p>Known by the name of Alto Peru, the country was ruled
for nearly three centuries by the Viceroy at Lima, and by
a Royal Audience of four men at Chuquisaca, now Sucre, the
nominal capital of the Republic. La Paz is noted as the
seat of the earliest effort (July, 1809) in South America for
democratic government. Though abortive, it was the inspiration
of later struggles. The battle of Ayacucho in
1824, which ended Spanish dominion over the continent, was
followed by the entrance into La Paz of General Sucre with
his victorious army, February 7, 1825. The Act of Independence
is dated August 6, 1825. The Republic was named
for Bolívar, who was elected President, while Chuquisaca
was made the capital with the name of Sucre. General
Bolívar, inaugurated in November, resigned in January,
1826, and was succeeded by General Sucre, the first President
who really served. More or less troublous times followed
until a war with Chile broke out in 1879 over the
export nitrate tax. At the conclusion of peace Bolivia lost
the small coast section of nitrate land, Antofagasta, which
she previously possessed. Since that time several revolutions
have occurred, one in 1920, but none affecting her
credit, her foreign contracts, or the lives of the people generally.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Government</span></h4>

<p>Bolivia is in form a centralized republic and has the usual
three branches. The President, who with two Vice Presidents
is elected for four years, and is ineligible for a consecutive
term, exercises almost absolute authority, although Congress
meets annually on the sixth of August. The President’s Cabinet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
is composed of six Ministers: of Foreign Relations and
Worship, Interior and Justice, Treasury, Promotion (Internal
Improvements), Public Instruction and Agriculture,
and War and Colonization.</p>

<p>The Senate has 16 members, the Chamber of Deputies
72. The administrators of the Departments and of the 63
Provinces, the Prefects and the Sub-prefects respectively,
are appointed by the President. Municipal Councils regulate
the local affairs of the cities. Suffrage is enjoyed by
male citizens over 21 (not domestics) who can read and
write, who have a fixed income of 200 bolivians, and whose
names are registered. The Supreme Court alone of the
three branches of government is located at the nominal
capital Sucre. The Judiciary has a Supreme Court with
seven Judges, a Superior Court in each Department, and
Provincial and Parochial Courts.</p>

<p>The Republic comprises eight Departments and three
Territories as follows:</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Population</span></h4>

<p>The population of Bolivia, about 2,800,000, as in Peru
is in three classes: the whites, numbering possibly 500,000,
Indians and mestizos most of the rest, the Indians largely
in the majority, though there are more than half a million
mestizos. A few thousand are negroes. Since the coming
of the Spaniards centuries ago, there has been no real immigration,
the mass of the people thus continuing Indian. The
whites, many of whom have some admixture of Indian
blood, are of course the ruling class. An aristocratic society
exists, the members of which follow French fashions and
customs and in considerable number have visited Europe.
A few persons have inherited or acquired by mining or
otherwise very large fortunes. Some persons of obviously
mixed race or mainly of Indian blood become educated, and
acquiring wealth take part in politics, hold office, and obtain
social position; more such than in Peru. There is a really
cultured society in all towns of moderate size.</p>

<p>The plateau Indians are chiefly Aymarás or Quichuas,
the former living around Lake Titicaca and throughout the
northern part of the plateau; while the Quichuas, strange
to say, are at the south, farther from their kindred in Peru.
The Aymarás are less prepossessing than the Quichuas,
more churlish, rather darker, similar in mode of life, though
a trifle more backward. They till the soil to some extent,
act as herdsmen, work in mines, and perform heavy labor
of any kind, carrying loads of 60-80 pounds, 20, 30, even 50
miles a day. The women are said to be stronger than the
men; both do spinning and weaving. The men are inveterate
chewers of coca, and men and women both are much given
to drunkenness. Of melancholy aspect, they seem devoid
of ambition. Generally submissive, if aroused they are revengeful
and murderous. Having received little attention
from the Government they are probably in poorer case
than when ruled by the Incas; they are believed to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
diminishing in numbers. Plans have been formed for improving
their condition.</p>

<p>The mestizos, also called cholos, feminine cholas, are the
industrial class of the nation, artisans, shopkeepers to some
extent, etc. The men dress in second class European style;
the cholas, one might say, half and half. As a rule the
cholos treat the Indians more harshly than do the real
whites, while to the latter they are rather servile. Some
cholos have distinguished themselves as writers and statesmen.
Two thirds of the population are said to live at or
above 12,000 feet. Several mining camps are at 15,000 to
16,000 feet.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Education</span></h4>

<p>Education is public, official, free, or private. Primary education
is called free and compulsory. The provision, formerly
inadequate, has recently been improved in accordance with
a well planned programme. There are about 900 primary
schools with 53,000 pupils, including private and kindergarten.
Fourteen <i>colegios nacionales</i> provide for secondary education
besides private schools under government supervision; in La
Paz and Cochabamba, two under Methodist auspices have accomplished
excellent work. Teachers are trained in four normal
schools, while professional or higher education is afforded
by Universities in La Paz, Sucre, and Cochabamba, Law
Schools at Oruro, Potosí, Santa Cruz, and Tarija, a School
of Theology at Santa Cruz. There are further a Mining
School, Institutes of Agronomy, Commerce, Modern Languages,
and Music; and four Schools of Arts and Trades,
the one at Cochabamba giving excellent results from instruction
in weaving wool, and in the use of native dyes. With a
view to extending and modernizing the education of women
coeducation is practised in most institutions and there are two
<i>liceos</i> for girls. Students of especial ability are sometimes
sent abroad for study, and foreign instructors are engaged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Press</span>, <span class="smcap">Religion</span>, <span class="smcap">Etc.</span></h4>

<p><b>Press.</b> The press, while important, is said to have less
influence than in the neighboring Republics, and it contains
less news of the world.</p>

<p><b>Religion.</b> The religion of the State is Roman Catholic,
but freedom is now granted to other forms of worship.
Civil marriage alone is legal, but is frequently neglected by
the Indians.</p>

<p><b>Telegraphic Communication.</b> The Capital is in telegraphic
communication with the rest of the world and with
the capitals of all the Departments. The country has over
200 offices, and 4350 miles of wire. A powerful wireless
station at Viacha, on the plateau 15 miles from La Paz,
communicates with the Pacific Coast and with passing ships.
Other stations are at Villa Bella, Cobija, Trinidad, Santa
Cruz, Ballivián, D’Orbigny, Esteros, Riberalta, Puerto
Suarez, and Yacuiba. Telephone service exists in La Paz
and Oruro.</p>

<p><b>Money.</b> The unit of Bolivian money is the <i>boliviano</i>,
equal to about 40 cents (.389) of our money. English and
Peruvian gold pounds are legal tender, equal to 12.50
<i>bolivianos</i>. The latter are divided into 100 centavos. Silver
coins are of 20 and 50 centavos. Bank bills of one and five
<i>bolivianos</i> and of higher denominations are in general use.</p>

<p><b>Weights and Measures</b> are of the metric system, but in
the interior the old Castilian system is chiefly employed.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Physical Characteristics</span></h4>

<p>The topography of Bolivia in general is similar to that of
Peru save for the absence of a coast section. The Sierra or
plateau region and the Trans-Andine continue those at the
north, though the latter differs from the Peruvian in that its
rivers reach the Atlantic Ocean, some by way of the Amazon,
others by the Paraná and La Plata, while the <i>montaña</i> of Peru
is wholly in the Amazon Basin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>The <b>Plateau Region</b> of Bolivia, 90 miles from the Pacific,
extends from northwest to southeast about 460 miles, with
an average width of 100 miles and an altitude of 12,500 feet.
It is bordered on the west by the Cordillera Occidental, containing
snowclad peaks, several of which are volcanoes,
many dormant or extinct, and on the east by the Cordillera
Oriental, the northern part of which is the Real or
Royal, a name eminently deserved. The two ranges come
together at the Knot of Cuzco or Vilcanota. Northeast of
Lake Titicaca is another confused mass or knot, the <i>Nudo</i>
of Apolobamba, where are said to be some of the highest
peaks of the Andes. The central plateau, once an inland
sea, and now including Lake Titicaca, slopes slightly from
the north, where it has a height above 13,000 feet. It is
broken in places by ridges and peaks, one over 17,000 feet
high, and is cut by a few cañons. In the West Cordillera
a number of peaks reach an elevation of 19,000, 20,000, or
21,000 feet; on the east the Cordillera Real contains several
above 21,000. Farther south in the lower ranges are some
peaks of volcanic character. A transverse ridge, the Serranía
de Lipez, terminates the Bolivian Plateau.</p>

<p>East of the southern part of the Cordillera Oriental is a
mountainous section of which the Sierra de Cochabamba
on the northeast and the Sierra de Misiones on the east
form the limit. Considerably farther east in the region of
the lowlands is the Sierra de Chiquitos between the Mamoré
and Guaporé Rivers, mere hills in comparison, with one
almost attaining 4000 feet. The highland or plateau section,
the only part visited by ordinary tourists or commercial
men, occupies hardly two fifths of the territory, the less
known lowlands three fifths.</p>

<p>The <b>Lowlands</b>, extending farther north than the Bolivian
plateau, comprise low alluvial plains, swamps, and lands
often flooded, including great forests and llanos. The great
forests are at the north in the Amazon Basin, the open plains
in that of the Plata.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p><b>Rivers.</b> The only rivers of consequence are those which
flow towards the Atlantic, with the exception of the Desaguadero,
about 200 miles long, the outlet of Lake Titicaca.
This river flows into Lake Pampa Aullagas or Poopo,
which has no outlet unless it be by an underground stream
to the Pacific, of which there are some indications. The
principal rivers of the Plata system, the Pilcomayo and the
Bermejo, flow southeast into the Paraguay River. More
numerous and important are the streams flowing northeast
belonging to the Amazon Basin, the chief of these, the
Beni, and the Mamoré, which form the Madera River. They
have many tributaries, the Beni having the Madre de Dios,
the Madidi, the Cochabamba, and others; the Mamoré receiving
the great boundary river, the Guaporé or Itenez, and
many more.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Climate</span></h4>

<p>Bolivia, still within the tropics, has the same variety of
climate as the countries previously described, the difference
in altitude causing the variation. The portion of the table-land
where the altitude is 12,000 to 13,000 feet, called the
<i>puna</i> by the natives, has two seasons which resemble autumn
and winter, the summer is so short and cool. The summer,
the season of snows, is from October or November to May;
the winter usually has slight precipitation. Little will grow
here except potatoes, barley, and <i>quinua</i>. The higher land up
to the snow line, perhaps 17,000 feet, called the <i>puna brava</i>,
is still colder, supporting grass only, where herders alone are
found with native flocks and rare mining settlements. Higher
still is eternal snow with almost Arctic temperature, -20° I
found it at night on a glacier on Mt. Sorata. A professor once
told me that at 16,000 feet he was unable to keep warm at
night however much clothing and blankets he used, but the
Indians, moderately clad and with bare feet, endure the cold
with apparent indifference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>The valleys as high as 12,000 feet, as in the case of La Paz,
are comparatively comfortable, being shielded from the bleak
winds of the plateau. From 9500 feet to 11,000 the climate
is sufficiently temperate for the raising of vegetables and
cereals. In what is called the Valley Zone, 5,000 to 9,000
feet, there is slight variation throughout the year, perpetual
summer and subtropical vegetation. Below are the <i>yungas</i>,
deep valleys with semitropical climate, and further the tropical
lowlands. Except for the last section the country as a whole
may be called healthful, diseases arising from bad habits, poverty,
ignorance, and unsanitary conditions, rather than as a
necessary result of the climate. In the lowlands, however,
tropical fevers and malaria are likely to exist, while many persons
are more or less affected by <i>soroche</i> on ascending to the
plateau from the sea. In La Paz the weather in winter is cool,
with a temperature occasionally below freezing and ranging
from 40° to 50° in the house. Snow though not uncommon
soon vanishes in the sun, and flowers like geraniums blossom
all the year in the open. In summer, with much more precipitation,
it usually rains in the valley, with snow often on the
<i>puna</i> and always on the mountains above.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br><span class="small">BOLIVIA: CAPITAL, DEPARTMENTS, CHIEF CITIES</span></h3>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Capital</span></h4>

<p><b>La Paz</b>, the de facto capital, population 107,000, is by
far the largest and most important city commercially. It
is the highest capital and large city in the world, also one
of the most picturesque, both on account of its location
at the bottom of a cañon, 1000 feet deep, and of its street
scenes with the strangely garbed Indians and cholos, and
the droves of llamas. The city has better sanitary arrangements
than Quito, the narrow streets are remarkably clean,
but some conveniences are lacking. There are electric lights
and cars, but a meagre water supply, and too few opportunities
for a bath. Good hotels are needed, the new “Paris”
and some older houses being wholly inadequate for present
necessities. The business of the city is largely in the hands
of foreigners, i.e., the best shops, and some of the banks
and importing houses. La Paz is the chief centre of trade
of the country, the Custom House here transacting by far
the most business, but supplemented by several others at
the east and south.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Departments</span></h4>

<p><b>La Paz</b> is the most northern Department of the plateau
region, the third largest, the first in population and importance.
It has Colonias north, El Beni and Cochabamba east,
Oruro south, and Chile and Peru west. La Paz has an
extremely varied landscape with a range in altitude from
640 to 21,750 feet at the top of Mt. Sorata, though some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
Bolivians give the altitude of this mountain as 24,000 feet.
Besides the Cordillera Real the Department includes Lake
Titicaca, or as much of it as does not belong to Peru. The
lake is remarkable as being the highest in the world on
which steamers regularly ply, 12,500 feet is an accepted
figure; 12,545 is also given. The lake has an area of 3200
square miles; it is about 120 miles long, 34-44 wide, and 330
feet deep, in places nearly 1000. Other figures are 145 miles
long and 69 broad, average depth 492 feet; temperature of
water 48°; annual rainfall about 78 inches. Besides the
bleak table-land west of the Cordillera Real, the Department
comprises many beautiful valleys east of the mountains.
It contains, with the capital La Paz, several important
though not large cities: Corocoro, a famed copper
centre; Sorata, north, a delightful spot, at an altitude of
8000 feet, a centre for the rubber industry and for mining;
Achacachi, a big Indian town near the Lake; Copacabana,
a very sacred religious shrine, also on the Lake; Coroicas,
east in the Yungas Valley. Actual or potential wealth of
almost every kind may be found here: large flocks of llamas,
alpacas, and some vicuñas; sheep and goats, herds of cattle
and horses; vegetable products, coca, cotton, coffee, cereals,
etc.; great riches in minerals, gold, silver, tin, copper, rock
crystal, berenguela, a fine native marble, all these in fine
quality and immense quantity. The wonderfully grand and
varied scenery of this Department can be duplicated or
rivalled in few quarters of the globe.</p>

<p><b>Oruro</b>, directly south of La Paz, between Potosí and
Chile, is the smallest of the Departments, entirely on the
plateau, thus having a much smaller range of altitude and
of climate. Its wealth is in minerals, especially silver and
tin, though gold, bismuth, borax, and sulphur are found.
Alpaca, chinchilla, and wool are other products.</p>

<p>The capital, Oruro, 127 miles south of La Paz, while
for years the terminus of the railway from Antofagasta,
became an important commercial and industrial centre; in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
addition it is one of the busiest mining districts. Half of
the mining men are foreigners; a large proportion of the
ordinary population is Indian. There is also agreeable
society, with people quite up to date in Paris fashions. The
only other city in the Department is Challapata.</p>

<p><b>Cochabamba</b>, south of El Beni, east of La Paz and
west of Santa Cruz, is sometimes called the granary of the
Republic. It is a particularly delightful region, half temperate
and half semitropical, with altitude ranging from
973 to 16,777 feet. It possesses immense plains with innumerable
herds of cattle, magnificent fertile valleys, rich
forests, and minerals.</p>

<p>Cochabamba, the capital, is the city next in size to La
Paz, 276 miles distant; with an altitude of 8387 feet it
enjoys a delightful climate, an average temperature of 66°,
and abundant rain. It has a good club, an American Institute
(a school for boys), and the least illiteracy. The recent
arrival of the railroad insures its rapid growth.</p>

<p><b>Potosí</b> is another plateau Department, both east and
south of Oruro, bordering also on Chuquisaca and Tarija,
and with Argentina south and Chile west. It has for the
most part a rather cold, disagreeable climate, the altitude
ranging from above 20,000 to a little over 6000 feet.</p>

<p>The name Potosí, for centuries famous as almost a
synonym for silver, belongs also to the capital city, at a
height of 13,388 feet. In 1650, when New York was a small
village, it had 160,000 inhabitants. The city has an excellent
mint, built in 1562, also a superb old cathedral, a good
library, and a museum. Above the town 32 artificial lakes
were constructed of which 22 are still good. The temperature
varies from 9° to 59°; it is said that they have
the four seasons in one day. Even here potatoes, barley,
and beans will grow, but living is very dear. The town has
foundries, engineering shops, and 28 smelters. The Department
still contains enormous quantities of silver and tin
in almost every variety of combination, and more towns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
that are rich mining centres than any other Department
except La Paz. Uyuni is a town of 6000 inhabitants, Colquechaca
has a population of 8000 miners; Tupiza, soon to
be reached by the railway, is a pretty city in a pleasant
valley, 66 miles from the Argentine border.</p>

<p><b>Chuquisaca</b>, east of Potosí and south of Cochabamba
and Santa Cruz, is much warmer, the altitude ranging from
255 to 13,450 feet. Here also are mines of the usual varieties
and petroleum too, tropical fruits and vegetables of course,
and plains with vast herds and flocks.</p>

<p>Sucre, the legal capital of the Republic, altitude 9328
feet, is situated on an arm of the Pilcomayo River. Social
distinctions are here more marked, and there is an exclusive
circle agreeable to those of the right type. Sucre, Cochabamba,
and La Paz are called the most cultured cities.
More than 300 miles from La Paz in a straight line and,
as it is on the east side of the Cordillera, much farther on
horseback, which until lately was the only way to journey
thither, except for some miles of staging, Sucre is now more
accessible, as will be indicated later.</p>

<p><b>Tarija</b>, south of Chuquisaca and southwest of Potosí, is
with Potosí the most southern of the Departments, now
smaller than formerly, since the Gran Chaco has been made
a separate Territory. Like Chuquisaca it is on the east side
of the Cordillera, the greatest altitude being 12,874 feet. The
climate obviously varies from temperate on the west to hot
in the lowlands, the productions varying similarly. There
are possibilities for all varieties of grain and fruit, as well
as for stock raising; the western part lies in the silver
region, having gold and copper as well.</p>

<p>The capital, Tarija, 80 miles east of Tupiza, is 250 miles
from Sucre and 600 by rail from La Paz, but a few days
must still be spent in stage or on horseback. Prospects
for speedy rail connection are good when rapid development
will follow.</p>

<p><b>Santa Cruz</b>, north of Chuquisaca and east of Cochabamba<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
is the largest Department of all, and the richest in
wild animals and vegetation. This Department, altitude
377-9754 feet, does not reach the great mountains, but far
to the east it has a little range of its own, the highest summits
of which are just below 4000 feet. Here are forests
and prairies, cattle, tropical fruit and vegetables; cotton
grows profusely, rice, <i>manioc</i>, coffee, <i>copal</i>, rubber, what you
will. Here too is petroleum, iron, quicksilver. The white
population is said to be of purer Spanish blood than in most
of the Departments, comparatively unmixed; but as the climate
is hot the people are naturally indolent.</p>

<p>The capital, Santa Cruz, altitude 1400 feet, 550 miles from
La Paz by way of Cochabamba, and 330 from Sucre, was
founded, only think! in 1545. It is on two of the main routes
running from Bolivia to Argentina and Paraguay. With a
population of 20,000, it is quite a city, having a variety of local
industries, and being on a favored route for the export of
rubber, sugar, and coffee to Europe; but the enormous cost
and difficulty of transportation retards its progress. Three
hundred and ninety miles east near the Paraguay River is
Puerto Suarez, two hours or 11 miles by cart road from
Corumbá, Brazil, to which point steamers come from Buenos
Aires. A railway too practically reaches Corumbá from São
Paulo.</p>

<p><b>El Beni</b>, the last of the Departments, occupies the northeast
portion of Bolivia, being divided from La Paz by the
Beni River. With an area of 100,000 square miles the
variation in altitude is slight, 465-2800 feet; hence everywhere
a hot climate. It has hardly 40,000 inhabitants,
mostly Indians. Nearly all the whites are engaged in the
rubber industry, though stock raising and agriculture are
slightly practised in the higher sections.</p>

<p>The capital, Trinidad, 400 miles from La Paz, with a
population of 5000, is the least important of the various
Department capitals, though containing many stores and
trading concerns for the sale of imported products. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
smaller places are of greater commercial consequence
and better known, on account of their location.</p>

<p><b>Colonias.</b> Of the Territories of Bolivia Colonias of the
Northwest is west of El Beni, and north of La Paz. Since
the settlement of the boundary dispute between Peru and
Bolivia, the area of the territory is given as 81,600 miles.
It is similar in character to El Beni, a great wilderness,
full of water courses and forests, a land of wonderful
vegetation; population 40,000, besides 15,000-20,000 wild
Indians, not to mention animals, mostly wild, gorgeous
birds, snakes and insects. The swamp fevers, it is said,
may be avoided by healthy persons who use proper precautions
and live on the highlands where forest clearings
permit the free course of the wind. Rain falls from December
to May, but May, June, and July are agreeable, with
night temperatures 60°-70°. In the warmest months the
range is 76°-90° in the hottest part of the day. In September
cool south winds bring sudden changes often producing
colds.</p>

<p>The capital, Riberalta, 920 miles from La Paz, at the
confluence of the Madre de Dios and the Beni, stands on a
high bank 65 feet above the water, which the main street
faces, an unusually desirable location. Its population, perhaps
4000, is increasing rapidly with the number of trading
houses and rubber exporters who own small steamers for
river traffic.</p>

<p>Villa Bella, 125 miles below Riberalta, at the junction of
the Beni and Mamoré, is on comparatively high land, facing
the Brazilian town, Villa Murtinho on the other side of the
Mamoré. On account of the favorable location for export,
rubber and timber property in the vicinity is especially
valuable. The climate is better than in many other sections
of the tropical lowlands.</p>

<p><b>El Oriente.</b> This Territory, uncertain as to area and
boundary, is lowland southeast of Santa Cruz, extending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
to the Paraguay River, north of the region claimed by
Paraguay.</p>

<p>The capital, Puerto Suarez, is a small place on a bayou
of the Paraguay River facing Corumbá.</p>

<p><b>Gran Chaco.</b> South of Santa Cruz and southeast of
Tarija, of which it was formerly a part, is the Territory of
Gran Chaco, where the boundary with Paraguay is still
undetermined. Fifty-seven thousand square miles is given
as the area. Here are low lying plains, some covered with
water in the rainy season (December to March), one or two
feet deep; also open forests with palms, willows, cedar,
carobs, and quebracho; and hilly sections occupied by wild
Indians.</p>

<p>Yacuiba, formerly the capital, which is now transferred
north to Villa Montes, is a town 200 miles southeast of
Tarija, and still the most important place in the territory.
In addition to forest riches, are those of the plains, now
harboring wild cattle, and undoubtedly suitable for stock
raising.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI<br><span class="small">BOLIVIA: PORTS AND TRANSPORTATION</span></h3>
</div>


<p><b>La Paz.</b> Bolivia unhappily has no seaport, but lake and
river ports are better than none; of these she has several.
Nevertheless La Paz is the chief port of entry with the
principal Custom House, the terminus of the three railways
leading from the Pacific.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Railways</span></h4>

<p><b>Route from Mollendo.</b> In 1903 not a single railway
reached La Paz, but not long after, the road, which then
left one on the great plateau, arrived at the edge of the
<i>alto</i>, whence by electric power the cars are brought down
the steep walls of the cañon to the picturesque city. This
route is the conclusion of the road from Mollendo, by all means
the most desirable for the traveler coming from the north.
The inconvenience suffered by many persons going from
the coast directly to the high table-land, and the real
danger to those with weak hearts, may be lessened or
entirely obviated by pausing two or three days in the
pleasant city of Arequipa. Even the compulsory stay of a
single night may render the journey to Puno innocuous to
the person in good condition. Having crossed the divide,
altitude 14,688 feet, one arrives at nightfall at Puno, on the
shore of Lake Titicaca, altitude 12,500 feet. The boat is
there taken for the night journey of 130 miles to Guaqui,
the Bolivian port at the south end of the lake, a 14 hour
sail which no one should miss; for in the morning an inspiring
vision may be had, hardly equalled on the globe, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
the magnificent Cordillera Real, a hundred mile stretch of
rugged snowclad peaks from Illampu to Illimani with Huaina
Potosí halfway. A splendid view of Illampu is had on the
left, during the three hours’ ride, 56 miles, over the almost
desert plateau, and after passing its edge a matchless
view of the cañon, the city, 1000 feet below, and Illimani
towering far above.</p>

<p><b>Arica-La Paz Railway.</b> The second route is from the
port of Arica, formerly in Peru, but now in the possession
of Chile, which country in accordance with the peace terms
with Bolivia of 1883 constructed the Arica-La Paz Railway
as far as the frontier, the most difficult portion, while Bolivia
laid the rails for 145 miles within her own boundaries. A
branch 5 miles long leads to the important mining town of
Corocoro. This is by far the shortest route from the coast,
only 281 miles, but as we have seen, this is a disadvantage
to travelers rather than a benefit; nor is there a gain in
time to one coming from the north, as the steamer arrives
at Arica, a day later than at Mollendo. As one may come
up from Mollendo, including the night at Arequipa, in 48
hours, one thus arrives in La Paz a few hours before one
who travels in 22 hours from Arica. The journey from
Mollendo is 534 miles. For the more rapid climb from Arica
there are 28 miles of rack railway with a maximum grade
of six per cent. The equipment of the road has been inadequate
for the business, but more has been ordered; larger
port works at Arica are needed and expected. The highest
point on the railway is 13,986 feet near the Bolivian boundary,
nearly 700 feet lower than on the road from Mollendo;
but being reached in less than half as many hours, and also
at night when the effect of the altitude is always greater,
even the most robust are likely to suffer from a headache
if not worse, as is the case with persons coming up from
Antofagasta. Going down by either route there is usually
no trouble, except for those who have been a long time
at the higher altitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p><b>Bolivia-Antofagasta Railway.</b> The journey to La Paz
from Antofagasta, on the Chilian coast 400 miles below
Arica, occupies two days for the 718 miles. This, the
earliest of Bolivian railways, with Oruro for years as the
terminus, in 1911 was continued to La Paz, <i>i.e.</i>, to Viacha
(15 miles from La Paz), where it meets the road from
Guaqui, the two forming a long link in the Pan American
chain. The later road now has its own line into the city.
At Uyuni, where there is a Custom House and a change of
cars, the road turns off towards Chile. From Ollague on the
Chilian border, a 58-mile branch runs to the Collahuasi copper
mines, among the richest in the world. A Bolivian extension is
now being made along the plateau to connect with the
Argentine road from La Quiaca to Buenos Aires. Already
Atocha has been reached; 60 miles remain to Tupiza, and
66 more to La Quiaca, the terminus of the Argentine railway
to the border. An automobile service is operated in
the dry or winter season from Atocha to La Quiaca, making
the journey in eight hours. The rest of the year one
goes on muleback. Thus by the weekly train from La
Quiaca to Buenos Aires in 48 hours, the entire journey,
2000 miles, may be made from La Paz much more quickly
than by way of Chile, in case one does not wish to go there.
This route also serves when the Trans-Andine is blocked
by the winter snow.</p>

<p><b>Other Argentine connections</b> are planned. A branch
railway is to be built from La Quiaca or possibly from
Orán to Tarija, about 82 miles; meanwhile it is expected
to construct an automobile road for the service. A railway
extension from the Argentine boundary farther east,
hoped for in the near future, is from Embarcación to
Yacuiba, thence to Santa Cruz, thus opening the cattle
region of the Chaco, of Chuquisaca, and Santa Cruz for the
export of cattle through Buenos Aires.</p>

<p><b>Several Branches.</b> Farther north important branches to
the interior are already in operation. The first, opened in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
1912, was from the station, Rio Mulato, 130 miles south of
Oruro, to far famed Potosí. This section, 108 miles long,
climbs to a height of 15,814 feet, the second highest altitude
reached by rail, following the Morococha branch of the
Central Peruvian. The cost was over $8,000,000, the maximum
grade three per cent. The trip occupies eight hours;
there is weekly service. The Oruro-Cochabamba Line was
completed in 1917; its length 132 miles, its cost above $10,000,000.
It crosses the Cordillera at about 14,000 feet. This
road is equally important, opening up a fine agricultural
and well populated district. Its fine scenic attractions
should allure the tourist. Food is very expensive on the
plateau, but with improved access to the warmer sections,
lower prices and greater variety of fruits and vegetables
may be expected above.</p>

<p>A branch on the plateau long in operation is a 24 mile
line from Uyuni to the Huanchaca silver mines, the road
owned by the Mining Company. Another branch is now
under construction from Machacamarca to Uncia, 57 miles,
built by Simon Patiño, the wealthy owner of extremely rich
tin mines at Uncia. Thirty-eight miles are in operation.</p>

<p><b>New Lines.</b> Under construction are two very important
lines: one the Potosí-Sucre Railway, 105 miles, with 40
in operation; the other, the La Paz-Yungas Line of very
difficult construction, passing over the mountain range near
La Paz at an altitude of 15,338 feet and going down into
the deep valley. One hundred and thirty-seven miles have
been surveyed. The passage has been accomplished, the
road opened to Unduavi, 16 miles, from which point it will
be continued down the valley to Coroico, later to Rurenabaque,
and some time to Puerto Brais on the Beni, the
latter port being open to navigation all the year. Already
a delightful road for tourist travel and useful for bringing
fruit, vegetables, and other products to the La Paz market,
has been constructed. With the completion of the road
to Puerto Brais, a more speedy route for travel and freight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
to Europe will be attained. On account of the scarcity and
high cost of coal this road is operated by electricity, for
which the great fall of small streams gives ample power.
On account of transportation difficulties and increased cost
the completion of the Potosí-Sucre Railway has been delayed,
but when this is realized the road will probably be
continued northeast to Santa Cruz. From this city a road
to Puerto Suarez on the Paraguay, now talked of, will come
later. Bolivia has about 1400 miles of railway in service.
A road to Santa Cruz from Cochabamba instead of Sucre
is advocated by many.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Other Forms of Transportation</span></h4>

<p><b>Roads.</b> Automobile roads are planned and being constructed
to fill as far as possible present requirements, but
in the rainy months, December to May, traffic is generally
suspended. From Cochabamba to Sucre there is motor
service for freight and passenger traffic, a more direct route
than that from Potosí for persons in La Paz. From Potosí
to Sucre a motor bus makes the journey in 12 hours.
Another motor car road soon to be available is from Riberalta
to Villa Church (65 miles), opposite Guajará-Mirím
in Brazil, the terminus of the Madeira-Mamoré Railway.
From Cochabamba autos run to Totora, also from La Paz
to Achacachi, and over a spur of Illampu down to Sorata.</p>

<p>Aside from railways land transportation is chiefly confined
to burros, mules, and llamas; in some places there are
mule wagons or ox-carts, mules generally carrying the
traveler. The cart roads, constructed and maintained by
the Government or the Municipality, are mostly very poor;
yet such as they are they extend 2000 miles. They are often
if not usually impassable in the wet season. Llamas are
more extensively employed than in any other country. In
the plateau region with their 100 pound burden they wander
leisurely along, cropping the coarse grass, tended by their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
Indian owners or drivers, who are in no more of a hurry
than they. Along difficult mountain slopes are paths constructed
by the Indians, skirting precipices and climbing
steep inclines, where llamas, mules, and burros bear loads
of minerals, coca, coffee, or other products or imports, from
one section to another. About 5000 mules and burros pass
over the La Paz-Yungas road daily. Except in the dry
season, May to October, travel either by mule or by stage
may anywhere be difficult or impossible on account of
rivers becoming impassable by reason of freshets or roads
because of mud. The importance of proper packing according
to directions of goods which may be shipped to the
interior, or indeed to any destination, cannot be overestimated.</p>

<p><b>Lake Transport.</b> Aside from the railways transportation
in Bolivia cannot be called excellent either on land or water,
though there is fair steamboat service on Lake Titicaca.
This with Lake Aullagas (Poopo) and the Desaguadero
River are the only waterways of the table-land where navigation
exists. On the larger lake the Railway Company
has steamers of 1500 tons or less, five in all, connecting
with the trains, and some touching at small ports on the
islands and around the Lake. Other boats are used, among
them Indian balsas, built entirely of reeds, sails and all.
In the use of these the Indians are very expert. The
Desaguadero River is navigable to Lake Poopo for steamers
of 500 tons. Poopo is navigable for boats of shallow draft.</p>

<p><b>River Transport.</b> Of great and increasing importance
are the rivers of the eastern slope, both those of the Amazon
Basin, and to a less degree those of the Paraguay, which
river for some distance is practically the eastern boundary
of Bolivia. Its chief tributaries are the Pilcomayo and the
Bermejo. Bolivian statistics give the total length of all
their navigable rivers as nearly 12,000 miles, but these
figures include sections not conceded as within the boundaries
of the Republic as well as rivers on the boundary.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
Half of the distance mentioned, 6000 miles, is said to be
navigable by steamers of 4-6 feet draft.</p>

<p>In the Amazon Basin steamboat navigation is possible
on the Acre from the Upper Purús, the Abuna, Orton,
Madre de Dios, Beni, Madidi, Mamoré, Itenez or Guaporé
Rivers, with some of their tributaries. Of the above, the
Beni and the Mamoré are the most important. On the
latter, regular steam service has recently been inaugurated
from Cuatro Ojos in Santa Cruz to Guajará-Mirím (a
distance of nearly 1000 miles), the terminus of the Madeira-Mamoré
Railway. From the Department Cochabamba,
boats descend on the rivers Chaparé, Chimoré, and Iabaro
to the Mamoré. The Guaporé, though easily navigable for
1000 miles, flowing through an uninhabited region, is little
used.</p>

<p>Although most of the streams are more or less obstructed
by rapids, rocks, and masses of tree trunks, which last
might easily be cleared away, they are nevertheless useful
for navigation. In spite of difficulties and dangers much
transport with canoes and rafts is effected by the Indians,
who are expert boatmen. On the Beni, rafts are used from
Puerto Pando 155 miles to Rurenabaque; from there steamboats
serve 573 miles to Riberalta; the Esperanza Rapids
below the town making their further passage impracticable.
Hence the journey to Villa Bella opposite Villa Murtinho
on the Madeira-Mamoré Railway or to Villa Church, higher
up, opposite Guajará-Mirím must be made by land; therefore
the motor road is being constructed.</p>

<p>In high water the Madre de Dios is navigable by
steamers far up its tributaries, at other times by <i>callapos</i>
which consist of two or three <i>balsas</i> fastened side by side. The
<i>balsa</i> here is a small raft made of several logs. It is usually
22 to 26 feet long, 5-6 wide, carries 750 pounds, and is managed
by three boatmen. A <i>callapo</i> or <i>monteria</i> may carry
3400 pounds with a crew of from 3 to 15 highly skilful men.
They make 9 or 10 miles daily, navigating 10-12 hours. With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
the return of normal conditions the development of this region
will be hastened, and greater benefits will be realized from the
opening of the Madeira-Mamoré Railway which occurred in
1912.</p>

</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Mining</span></h4>

<p>The mining industry, at present the most important
in Bolivia, is likely to continue the leader for an indefinite
period, although with easy communication and large population
in the lower districts it may ultimately have a rival
in forestal and agricultural products, or in cattle, certain
to be at least a very valuable adjunct. The mineral riches
of Bolivia may equal if they do not surpass those of Peru,
though except for silver and tin they are probably less
known. They include almost every variety of the precious
metals, with others not so classed. To mention a few of
these, there are gold, silver, tin, copper, bismuth, lead,
antimony, tungsten, platinum, zinc, petroleum, with fine
marbles, alabaster, malachite, opals, emeralds, jasper, borax,
salt, etc. There are thousands of known lodes, but comparatively
few are worked. The statement of the scientist,
Raimondi, that the plateau of Bolivia is a table of silver
supported on columns of gold is declared by Walle to be
no exaggeration. A few of the mining belts where some
work has been carried on will be mentioned.</p>

<p><b>Gold.</b> At the present time little is done in the way of
gold mining, tin and copper being more fashionable. Another
reason for inactivity in this line is that the Bolivians
possess the majority of the more favorably situated holdings,
which they refuse to part with except at prohibitive
prices or possibly at all, hoping some day themselves to
be able to operate them. It is true that in the early colonial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
days enormous quantities of gold and silver both were produced
and exported, although obtained by crude mining
methods. It is thought that with modern machinery excellent
if not better results may yet be obtained. In the 210
years previous to 1750 more than 12 billion dollars worth
of gold was produced in the country. There has been a
falling off since then, but one family in the last century
obtained over $3,000,000 from their property. Between 1868
and 1900 over $120,000,000 is believed to have been produced.
In many sections gold is known to exist in abundance
and with further exploration it will doubtless be discovered
in others. It is found in alluvial deposits, also in
veins or lodes of quartz, from which the deposits are the
washings. Veins of antimony which are common in Bolivia
contain gold in chemical or mechanical mixture.</p>

<p>There are three regions where gold is found, all of considerable
extent: the first and best known crosses the
provinces of the Department of La Paz, chiefly on the east
slopes of the Cordillera Real, continues through that of
Cochabamba and runs out in Santa Cruz towards the Rio
Paraguay. In La Paz are the well known deposits of the
Tipuani River, of Chuquiaguillo, and many others. The
second region begins in the southwest corner of the country,
and passing south of Tupiza turns north through Potosí
towards Santa Cruz. The third is in the northwest part
of the Republic, joining the similar section in Peru. Although
said to be the richest of all, it is practically unexploited
and unexplored.</p>

<p>While the opinion is held that the lack of means of
communication is all that prevents a large production of
gold in Bolivia, I believe that to Americans this is a smaller
drawback than the distance of the whole country from the
United States; this objection will have less weight in the
future. Certainly the hardships of those regions and the
difficulty in reaching many of them is slight indeed in comparison
with the trials experienced by early Alaskan miners.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
The Tipuani, for instance, is within a day’s horseback ride
from the pretty town of Sorata, population 8000. Chuquiaguillo,
now owned by an American company, is within
easy walking distance of La Paz. Others are more remote,
most of them on the eastern slope of the Cordillera Real,
to be reached over passes of 15,000 feet or more, yet within
a few days’ ride of civilization. The single region of the
Tipuani is 120 miles long.</p>

<p>Besides the opportunities for placer mining there are
strata formed of sand, clay, and stones, from 50 to 330 feet
deep. Sometimes in these there are veins with gold in thin
flakes 98 per cent pure. Some workings are open, others
in shafts and galleries like an ordinary mine. However,
difficulty is experienced in taking machinery over the poor
trails, and also in obtaining labor. In May, 1904, a nugget
was found at Chuquiaguillo containing 47 ounces of pure
gold, nearly $1000 worth. One hundred miners are employed
here at 50 cents to $1.50 a day. In the Province of
Velasco, Department of Santa Cruz, is a region considered
by Walle more accessible than others, to which one would
come from the Atlantic to Corumbá on the Paraguay River
or perhaps by rail from São Paulo, and enter Bolivia across
the plains. It is thought that Bolivia may become one of
the leading gold producers of the world.</p>

<p><b>Silver.</b> The silver mines are better known and are now
worked on a larger scale than the gold, although 10,000
lodes are practically abandoned or operated slightly. The
suspension was not because of a scarcity of silver but for
lack of capital, means of transport, and suitable machinery;
also its lower price. A few of the largest mines have continued
to be regularly worked. With the recently higher
price of silver, greater activity has prevailed than a few
years earlier. The richest of the ores contain from 10 to
50 per cent of silver and even 80; more has from 1 to 10
per cent.</p>

<p>The Department of Potosí is world renowned for its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
silver. In the first 40 years of colonial production more
than $70,000,000 was taken from the Cerro Potosí, a sugar
loaf 16,000 feet above the sea, in which 5000 mines have
been opened. Up to the present time a billion dollars, one
writer says four billion, have been realized from the silver
of Bolivia. In neighboring Provinces of the same Department,
Potosí, are many other mines, most of which now
produce tin as well. The ores of Potosí which originally
contained 60 per cent or more of silver are now poorer
with more iron pyrites. The present queen of South American
silver mines, the Huanchaca-Pulacayo, east of Uyuni,
consists of a dozen groups over 8500 acres, a bed of fabulous
richness. In the 28 years before 1901 it produced 4250 tons
of silver. The majority of the stock is held in France.
Some years ago the Pulacayo mines were flooded with hot
water, but they have now been drained and are again
operated. On the property is a town of 10,000 people,
hundreds of whom are employed in the works, including
women who first try out the ore. In 1918 $2,622,000 worth
of silver was produced.</p>

<p>Oruro is next to Potosí in production of silver, and in
tin it stands first. The richest silver ores, as at Huanchaca,
are so exported, the poorer are treated on the spot. Other
rich mines are well known.</p>

<p><b>Tin</b> mining is a more recent industry, dating from 1895.
Already it has become the leading export of the country,
which now provides more than one-third of the world’s
supply. It was well known to the Spanish colonists as
much of it was mingled with the silver, but they rejected
it as rubbish, using it to fill in depressions. Large profits
have been recovered from these fillings and from the dumps.
While tin is produced in many other parts of the world,
the Bolivian lodes are of unusual extent and richness. Their
production is now exceeded only by that of the Straits
Settlements. Since the development of the tin plate industry
and its use in other ways the demand for tin and the price<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
have enormously increased; from $350 a ton in 1898 to $900
before the war. In 1912 tin was produced, barilla, 60 per
cent pure, 37,700 tons, worth $18,000,000; in 1918 the value
of tin exported was $45,364,000.</p>

<p>All along the eastern part of the plateau from Lake
Titicaca to the southern boundary, tin is found in thick
unbroken lodes. The three principal districts are La Paz,
Oruro, Potosí. In La Paz the best known mines are on the
slopes of the splendid mountain, Huaina Potosí in the
Cordillera Real, though many other mines are worked.
Those in the Department of Oruro are more important,
producing one-third of the output. The lodes vary in thickness
from a few inches to 10, 15, or 20 feet. Rich pockets
are found 30-60 feet in diameter, and veins with stannic
oxide fragments, running from 50 to 100 per cent. Cassiterite,
tin stone, or tin with stannic oxide, is frequent with
55-60 per cent tin; this is sent to Europe as extracted. The
percentage of tin in a lode is very variable, often 6-8 per
cent, sometimes 15. Veins of tin on the Cerro Potosí penetrate
the hill parallel to veins of silver; some are united;
in others tin, silver, and copper alternate or are in union.
The tin is generally in the upper part nearer the surface.
Sulphides are found at Oruro, but oxides are more frequent.
All are at an altitude of about 10,000-17,000 feet. The large
Socavón Company employs 1000 hands, has a concentrating
plant, and puts out six tons of silver and 250 tons of
tin yearly. Many other mines export barilla, some of it
with 70 per cent of tin. A Bolivian, Simon J. Patiño, from
being an ordinary laborer has risen to be the Tin King,
both banker and mine owner, working his mines by modern
methods and electric machinery. His mines at Uncia are
among the richest in the world, producing about 30 per
cent of the Bolivian total. The Llallagua mines, the richest
of all, have still greater production.</p>

<p>On Huaina Potosí are placers containing with tin, gold
in flakes, bismuth, and oxide of iron; more in other locations.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
The Company owning the Chlorolque Mountain and
other properties, with tin as the principal product, mines
also silver, bismuth, copper, and wolfram; it paid a 30 per
cent dividend in 1917. Capital only is needed to exploit on
a much larger scale these rich and available deposits. Three
hundred to four hundred dollars a ton hardly paid the cost
of production, but with prices three times as much it is a
highly profitable business. The Guggenheims have recently
purchased three tin mines located at Caracoles on the
Quimsa Cruz Range, south of Illimani, to which they have
built an automobile road 150 miles from Eucalyptus, a
station on the main line between La Paz and Oruro. The
mines are at an altitude of 16,000 to 18,000 feet, the quarters
at 15,000 to 16,000. The tin runs to 10-15 per cent. It is
thought that the property will rival the Uncia. The International
Mining Company has a tin property in the Yungas
Province 52 miles from La Paz at a height of 8000 feet, a
rather more comfortable altitude.</p>

<p><b>Copper.</b> Of late the copper deposits in Peru and Chile
have received more attention than those of Bolivia, but
this country also has extensive formations from Lipez at
the south where white copper is found, along the East
Cordillera, past Potosí and Oruro to Corocoro in the West,
ending in the Nudo of Apolobamba. Veins occur in all the
buttresses of the Andes.</p>

<p>Copper is found chiefly in its native state, the deposits
of Corocoro being especially famous. The copper here
occurs in powder, plates, or nodules, in beds of reddish
sandstone. One veta, or mineralized bed, is 1000 yards deep,
extending several miles; another, a branch formation above
this surrounds it on the southwest and east, occupying a
great part of the Desaguadero Valley. Both formations are
arseniates. One branch 2000 yards thick extends 6 miles;
in another direction a branch runs 35 miles from Corocoro
to Chacarilla, then branching south and east. Copper
generally occurs in small irregular grains with from 70 to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
92 per cent copper. The native copper, the great wealth of
the mines, here ranges from microscopic grains to plates
and arborescent forms called charquis. At La Charcarilla
large plates are found 3¹⁄₂ inches thick. Ores with 15-20
per cent copper are usually neglected. As there are no good
kilns, barilla is exported 80 per cent pure, a quintal, 220
pounds, costing $3-4 for production. Except from Corocoro
the present output is insignificant. For a time these
mines were abandoned owing to the low price of copper
and the difficulty of transport. It was formerly necessary
to send the barilla by carts, mules, or llamas to the port
of Arica, or else to the Desaguadero River, to be carried in
boats to Lake Titicaca and Puno, thence by rail to Mollendo.
With the great increase in the price of copper and
the opening of the Arica-La Paz Railway with a 5 mile
branch to Corocoro, these difficulties were removed and
active work progressed with a broad field for enlargement.
Copper formation here is said to resemble greatly those in
Northern Michigan, such as the Copper Range, and the
Calumet and Hecla. In 1917 over 82,000,000 pounds were
exported, worth above $4,000,000.</p>

<p><b>Lead</b> is found in the region of La Quiaca and some
is exported by way of Argentina. Galena, an ore of lead
and silver, is widespread.</p>

<p><b>Bismuth.</b> Of less used minerals bismuth may be mentioned,
in the production of which Bolivia leads the world
and controls the supply. At present, chiefly used as a drug
on account of its high price, it might be more largely
employed in alloys. Bismuth ore, as carbonates, oxides,
and arsenical sulphates, is so abundant in many parts of
Bolivia that if bismuth sold at 20 cents a pound a fair profit
would be realized. With the price for years $3500 a ton,
it would seem a profitable business to engage in. Over one
million pounds were exported in 1918 worth one and a half
million dollars.</p>

<p><b>Antimony</b> also is found in large quantities. Nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
18,000 tons were exported in 1916, worth approximately
$5,000,000, but with high prices and abnormal demand due
to the war. Less than one per cent of the quantity was
exported in 1912. The ores are rich, often running 70 per
cent pure metal.</p>

<p><b>Zinc</b> in the form of sulphides or blends is abundant,
largely in connection with silver. Such ores are sent to
Europe, there to be separated, the scarcity and almost prohibitive
price of coal rendering such a course desirable for
various products, to avoid the excessive cost of smelting;
at the same time the high cost of transportation limits the
export.</p>

<p><b>Wolfram</b>, an iron-manganese tungstate, is found near
veins of tin and much is exported, the production being
especially in the Santa Cruz district, at the northeast of
Cochabamba. Some lodes contain no less than 50 per cent
of tungstic acid, the ores concentrated for export running
higher. About 7¹⁄₂ million pounds were exported in 1918
valued at nearly $3,708,000.</p>

<p><b>Coal.</b> The lack of good coal is the chief fault in nature’s
economy in Bolivia. Its usual cost in La Paz is $40-$50
a ton, at times $75. It is therefore used as little as possible,
although some is imported. While Bolivia has been said
to possess no coal at all, a lignite of fair quality has been
discovered in the peninsula of Copacabana, Lake Titicaca,
some of which has been used by the Guaqui-La Paz Railway
to develop electric power; but not in serious fashion,
experimental merely. Other seams are found near the
Ayoapó station, which a company has been organized to
exploit. Good samples have come from Tacora on the
Arica Railway near the frontier, the coal said to be equal
to that of Coronel in Chile, the seams rich and thick. If so
their exploitation will immensely advance the industries
of the country. Good coal is reported across the mountains
from Sorata and lignite is found near Cochabamba.</p>

<p>On account of the enormous cost of coal, various substitutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
are in use. On the plateau there is practically no
wood. For heating, foreigners generally employ oil stoves,
the natives nothing at all, though the mercury may range
from 40° to 50° in the house on a winter’s day. In La
Paz for cooking purposes a substance called <i>taquia</i> is
employed. It looks like pecan nuts, but is the dung of
llamas, which is collected by Indians on the plateau or
elsewhere. It sells generally at about $4 a ton, but has
lately risen to $7. It is the principal fuel used at the mines
of Corocoro. In some places as at Potosí, <i>yareta</i> is used,
a vegetable or shrub which grows in a dense mass to a
height of several feet with a greater diameter. The green
mass has a woody fibre, is highly resinous, and burns like
peat, giving a good amount of heat. It grows at altitudes
between 13,000 and 16,000 feet. Another woody shrub, a
species of broom called <i>tola</i>, is used, with another, <i>quenua</i>,
which like charcoal gives much heat with little ash. Extensive
peat beds exist near La Paz, estimated to yield 30,000,000 tons
of briquettes with a fuel value about half that of coal. The
discovery and wide exploitation of coal and petroleum would
be an immense boon both to industry and to the householders.</p>

<p><b>Petroleum</b> is now believed to exist in large quantities,
sufficient to solve the fuel problem. The best known fields
are in the southeast where seepages occur and a belt is
indicated extending northwest and southeast 150 miles from
the Argentine border. Concessions covering millions of
acres have been granted to American companies. The zone
traverses the Provinces of Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca, and
Tarija. Geological investigations indicate that a petroleum
belt or basin exists along the foothills of the east side of
the East Cordillera. There are indications in the Beni
district a considerable distance north of La Paz, and beyond
the Madidi in Colonias. A probable thickness of over-lying
strata in southeast Bolivia is 160-660 feet. If so development
costs will be diminished. The great difficulty is the
inaccessibility of the locations. On this account few wells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
have yet been sunk. To pipe the oil up to the plateau
would be an expensive, some say an impracticable, proposition.
At present approached only by cart roads or caminos,
the fields will be rendered more accessible by the railways
planned from Puerto Suarez or Pacheco and from Argentina
to Santa Cruz. The oils vary in quality, some having an
asphalt base with 4 per cent of gasoline, up to .81 specific
gravity with 40 per cent of gasoline. The heavier is in the
lower sands. Along the eastern base of the Andes the petroleum
is of high grade. Samples of oil from Espejos
Spring, 12 leagues from Santa Cruz, indicate the quality
expected north to the Madre de Dios. This has 78 per cent
kerosene, 17 lubricating oil, and 4 per cent coke. From indications
it is believed that gushers would come by boring
to proper depth. It is said that deposits of good quality
are indicated at Calacoto on the Arica Railway, a continuation
of the Titicaca fields of Peru. These are obviously
much more accessible but less assured.</p>

<p>Mining properties of various kinds may be acquired and
worked to good advantage, some with a moderate outlay
of capital; with larger returns, naturally, from greater expenditure
for the best equipment and more extensive properties.
There is work for centuries.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Industries</span></h4>

<p>Other than mining industries are slightly developed,
being local in character for lack of proper transportation.
There is therefore opportunity for their introduction, the
needs meanwhile being supplied by importation.</p>

<p><b>Weaving.</b> The weaving industry is one for which the
natives are peculiarly adapted; the Indians and the mestizos
now produce with crude equipment goods of excellent quality
for strength and often for color. In certain Provinces
good strong cotton cloth is made which, used for sheeting,
clothing, etc., lasts indefinitely. The natives make also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
heavy woolen stuff from llama wool, and fine soft material
from vicuña, alpaca, and silk. But not half enough is woven
to supply the demand, so that much coarse cotton cloth
and a woolen called <i>bayeta</i> are imported for the use of the
Indians, as well as fine goods for the white population. The
llamas, estimated as numbering 500,000, are worth from $4 to
$10 each; the alpacas, about half as many, are valued at
$50-75 each. There are also 500,000 goats.</p>

<p><b>Rugs and skins</b> are exported in small quantities, the
animals from which these are taken growing rarer and liable
to become extinct. Rugs of <i>vicuña</i> skin have at least doubled
in price since 1906 (their export is forbidden), as is the case
also with the chinchilla. Of the latter there are two varieties,
the blue and the white. They are hunted by the Indians as
are also the vicuñas. The former are now crossed with the
<i>viscacha</i>, a rodent resembling a hare, the resulting animal
being capable of domestication. Though the skins are inferior
to genuine chinchilla they serve the purpose.</p>

<p>It would be a most valuable enterprise if the vicuña could
be domesticated. At present the animals are wild like the
<i>guanaco</i>, but the breeding of herds ought to be possible if the
greatest care were exercised. The <i>vicuña</i> wool is probably
the finest existing, and if the animals could be saved from
destruction and their numbers increased, a highly profitable
business would result. These animals, like the <i>guanacos</i>,
wander in small groups in remote places at high altitudes,
14,000 to 16,000 feet, often difficult of access among the
mountains. These with the llamas and alpacas are ruminants,
the two latter domesticated and living in large herds.</p>

<p>The alpaca wool is much superior to that of the llama
and better than that of the sheep; if the animals were
rationally bred on a large scale the business should be extremely
profitable. The animal has shorter legs than the
llama which it resembles; it is never used as a burden bearer.
The alpaca flourishes on the Titicaca Plateau and in higher,
cold and solitary mountain sections, among seed bearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
grasses where snow falls instead of rain. It requires better
forage than the llama. Pure water is an absolute essential.
Their long fleece, sheared once in two years, is always in
great demand; a fleece weighs 10-15 pounds. The alpacas,
numbering probably 200,000, are tended by Indians whose
patient endurance qualify them in a measure, but who need
instruction to supervise them with more intelligent care.
There are vast lands suitable for their breeding and culture,
and regions where sheep, donkeys, goats, and cattle may
be raised. None of these industries is practised except in a
small way, though land, suitable fodder, and climate are all
of the best.</p>

<p><b>Stock raising</b> is carried on to a limited extent only,
though conditions for raising horned cattle are said to be
ideal on the llanos of the southeast, where vast natural
prairies alternate with forests, and many wild cattle exist.
The large possibilities of this region will undoubtedly be
utilized before many years. Difficulty in reaching markets
is the great present drawback, but Argentine capitalists
have looked over the eastern lowlands and may find early
means for their exploitation. On the higher lands also are
sections where the business may be carried on to advantage.
As at present only ordinary stock is raised with no
care in breeding, merely to supply local needs for meat,
there is need of imported cattle and better methods, as is
the case with sheep. Figures given for cattle are 800,000
head, of sheep 1¹⁄₂ million. Many more of the latter should
be raised in some sections of the plateau region. Mutton
is more of a staple food, largely used, dried and salted, by
the Indians. Thus prepared it is called <i>chalona</i>; dried-beef
is called <i>charque</i>. The cultivation of Siberian grasses on the
plateau is suggested. Few hogs are raised, although many
districts are well adapted to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Agriculture</span></h4>

<p>In agriculture Bolivia has enormous possibilities, but at
present small production. About 5,000,000 acres are under
cultivation. With the varying altitude and climate the vegetable
products are similar to those of the preceding countries,
many of these spontaneous, a few cultivated. The latter are
almost solely for internal consumption. On the plateau grow
barley, <i>quinua</i>, and potatoes, the last, when frozen called
<i>chuño</i>, are the basis of the Indians’ diet; barley is much used
for fodder; <i>quinua</i>, a very nutritious millet, easy to cultivate
and hardy, in the form of meal among the plateau Indians takes
the place of wheat and corn, which do not grow at this altitude.
In the valleys below there is plenty of corn, from which
is made the Indians’ favorite drink, <i>chicha</i>, though they will
readily drink plain alcohol of poor quality when they can get
it. Wheat and rice are raised in eastern Cochabamba, admirable
coffee in the <i>yungas</i>, cacao, and coca; none in sufficient
quantity to supply the home market except coca. Some coffee
is exported but more is imported from Brazil and Peru. All
needful supplies could be provided in one or another part of
the country if population and means of transport existed.</p>

<p><b>Other Products.</b> Cacao is less cultivated than coffee,
though raised in two departments. Trees are growing untended
in the Rio Madidi and Madre de Dios sections.
Sugar cane is cultivated in Santa Cruz and elsewhere, but
most of it is used for making <i>aguardiente</i>, and molasses or
other syrup. More than 200,000 gallons of alcohol come
annually from Santa Cruz. Rice also is grown in this Department
giving two harvests a year. It might be cultivated
in other sections. Tobacco of excellent quality thrives in
many places, but not enough is raised for home consumption.
Viticulture is slightly practised with primitive methods.
Fruits of many varieties as in Peru are raised,
including especially fine oranges. Various vegetables are
grown but in these lines the development is slight and poor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p><b>Coca</b> alone is exported among agricultural products,
chiefly to Chile and Argentina. Cultivated also in Cochabamba
and Santa Cruz, the chief centre is in the <i>yungas</i> of
La Paz. The leaf is richer in alkaloid than the Peruvian, as
I myself noted, but as yet it has not been so much exported
to Europe on account of its higher price. The plantations are
in terraces on the mountain slopes between 5000 and 7000 feet
altitude. In the <i>yungas</i> the bushes are usually three or four
feet high, but may grow to seven or eight. A small crop may
be gathered 18 months after planting, but only in four or five
years are they in full leaf. Three times a year the leaves are
gathered, and with good care the plantations will last half a
century. The leaves are picked by hand, dried, and stored in
a dry place, later packed in bales and pressed. Properly used
the chewing of coca in the highlands may be a blessing. Carried
to the excess usual among the Indians it is a curse, as it
is where here used in drinks sold at the soda counter, creating
a habit as vicious as that of alcohol or opium. For the cultivation
of cotton on the lowlands there is much suitable soil
and climate.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Forestry</span></h4>

<p>Of forestal products Bolivia contains all those found in the
other sections of the Amazon basin, varieties of timber, medicinal
plants, etc.; but none at present is of commercial
value for export except quinine, manufactured from <i>cinchona</i>
bark, and rubber.</p>

<p><b>Rubber.</b> The rubber industry of Bolivia is second to
that of minerals. In amount of this export the country is
believed to be second in South America to Brazil, though
little has been touched of the vast territory capable of its
production. Sir Martin Conway estimated the rubber trees
of the Beni district as 50,000,000. There are four zones of
rubber producing country, one in the extreme north near
the Acre Territory of Brazil, with outlet from the port and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
custom house of Cobija; second, the greater part of Colonias
exporting through the national custom house of Villa Bella,
by Villa Rica at the confluence of the Abuna and the Madeira,
or by lesser ports; third, the Department of La Paz,
the rubber going out by Lake Titicaca and Mollendo;
fourth, Beni, Santa Cruz, and Cochabamba, the rubber from
the north going out by Guajará Merím or Villa Bella, that
farther south by Puerto Suarez on the Paraguay or by
Yacuiba, and from the west by Oruro and Antofagasta.
The rubber of the region is chiefly that called fine <i>Pará</i>, most
of it exported through that port and being of the best quality.
The latex of the <i>hevea</i> is the source; <i>sernamby</i> is second quality
made of the residue of the finer quality mixed with bark. The
<i>caucho</i> from the <i>castilloa elastica</i> is little exploited on account
of few laborers and expensive transport. With the opening of
the Madeira-Mamoré Railway in 1912 better facilities were
secured, this railway having been built a distance of 207 miles
along the Brazilian shore to avoid the bad rapids on the two
rivers. The flooding of the market with Malay and Ceylon
rubber seriously affected Bolivian production and export, but
these have recently increased. With the forming of plantations
in this section, a work which an American company has undertaken,
the rubber should be better able to compete with that
of Ceylon, as its superior quality is known. The fact that
the Bolivian export tax is lower than that of Brazil gives the
former an advantage.</p>

<p>In the Department of Cochabamba are great quantities of
<i>maniçoba</i> trees producing rubber known as <i>ceará</i>, of good
quality but not the best. It might be cultivated in hilly regions
and on banks of streams of the Yungas and other valleys in
the Department of La Paz. The lot of the <i>seringueiros</i>, the
rubber workers, is bad; it may and must be bettered if the
industry is to continue. The establishing of plantations will
be a great improvement, but some amenities of life might be
made available even in the ordinary forest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Investments</span></h4>

<p>From the description of Bolivia, it is apparent that mining
presents the most attractive field for the large capitalist.
Mining experts with less money may be tempted to investigate
gold prospects or to search for rich veins of other
metals, later organizing companies for their development
or selling at a handsome profit their acquired claims, as
some persons have done hitherto. However sales are not
always easily made. Petroleum is numbered among the
mining possibilities, although the most favorably located
fields may be preempted already, chiefly by American Companies,
the Braden and the Richmond Levering, in spite of
the difficulties of access and development. The petroleum
procured would find its market in Bolivia and in the neighboring
countries of the East and West Coasts where it is
greatly needed. The oil with a paraffin base is of high grade
running to 45.8 Baumé.</p>

<p>Stock raising of various kinds would be profitable in
certain localities, and some forms of agriculture and small
industries. Railway construction, the development of electric
power, the installation of sanitary and other public
works will afford many openings for engineers.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII<br><span class="small">CHILE: AREA, HISTORY, GOVERNMENT,
POPULATION, ETC.</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The country of Chile, the seventh in size of the South
American Republics, is frequently ranked with the two
largest, Brazil and Argentina, owing to the enterprise of its
inhabitants: a natural result of their location in the temperate
zone, from 17° 57′ to 55° 59′ South Latitude; increased
perhaps by their long struggle with the Araucanian
Indians.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Area, Population, Boundary</span></h4>

<p><b>Area.</b> Chile, with an extent of 290,000 square miles, is
ribbon like in shape, having a length of nearly 2700 miles,
a trifle more than Argentina; in a direct line 2140 miles,
with a width of 70-248, miles averaging about 85.</p>

<p><b>Population.</b> The country with approximately 4,000,000
inhabitants is fifth in this respect.</p>

<p><b>Boundary.</b> The boundary of Chile is simple. At the
north is Peru, on the east are Bolivia and Argentina, at the
south and west the Pacific Ocean.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">History</span></h4>

<p>The bold Spanish invaders of Peru might reasonably
have been contented for a time with the conquest of that
vast territory. But Diego de Almagro, incited by the grant
of 200 leagues south of those bestowed upon Pizarro, and
enticed by the tales of a region richer still in gold and silver,
set forth to gain possession of the allotted lands, not long
after the founding of Lima in 1535. Over the great Bolivian
Plateau and a high mountain pass into Chile, Almagro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
marched with his followers, only to return disappointed
after enduring untold hardships and suffering.</p>

<p>A few years later a second expedition was undertaken
by Pedro de Valdivia, this one along the shore. From Arica
proceeding by sea, having landed at the mouth of the Rio
Maipo, in February, 1541, Valdivia founded the city of
Santiago. Still unsatisfied he continued south, in spite of
much opposition, making settlements at Concepción, Imperial,
Villa Rica, and Valdivia; but in 1553 he was himself
slain by the warlike Araucanians, who long disputed with
the invaders the occupation of their country. For 250 years
the contest continued intermittently, with some diminution
and amalgamation of the Indians, till the Chilians rose against
Spain, when a more friendly feeling was established.</p>

<p>The Chilians, who convoked a national congress in 1810,
regard this event as the inauguration of their independence;
though not until 1818 was it secured with the aid of San
Martín and his army from Argentina. Chile subsequently
experienced many internal difficulties, but after 1861 the
Government became more liberal, and since that period,
except for the revolution against Balmaceda in 1890, the
country has been free from serious internal strife.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Government</span></h4>

<p>The government is that of a centralized republic with the
usual three branches. The President, elected for a term of
five years and not eligible at once for a second term, appoints
the <i>Intendentes</i> and <i>Gobernadores</i> who respectively administer
the 23 Provinces, and their subdivisions, the 82 Departments.
There is one Territory, Magallanes, which includes the southern
mainland and the coastal islands. The police force is
national in organization. In the Provinces no legislative bodies
exist save municipal councils with certain local duties. The
franchise is so restricted (the voters must have property
and be able to read and write) that as 25 per cent of the
population is illiterate and most of the laboring class landless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
the Government is said to be practically in the hands
of a few leading families. Senators, 37 in number, must
have an income of $2000 and Deputies, 118, one of $500.
The President must not leave the country while in office.</p>

<p>Chile has 23 Provinces, all but five of which border on
the Pacific, and one Territory. Beginning at the north the
names of the Provinces follow with their approximate areas
and population, and with the names and population of their
capitals:</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Population</span></h4>

<p>The population of Chile is little if any below 4,000,000,
which gives it an average of 12 or more to the square mile,
the highest rate of all the North and West Coast countries.
There is considerable variation in the different Provinces,
but less than in the other Republics, if the Territory is
omitted. The most thickly inhabited region is from Valparaiso
south to Valdivia; the Province of Santiago having
the largest population and that of Valparaiso the densest.
As to the character of the population it is estimated that 40
per cent are of white extraction, with at least 50-60 per
cent mestizos; probably 50,000 Indians, including possibly
5000 in the far south, uncivilized and dying out. The educated
class as in other countries forms a small minority
of the inhabitants, but in recent years greater attention
has been paid to the diffusion of knowledge among the common
people.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Education</span></h4>

<p>The middle and upper classes pay much attention to education.
In Santiago there are two universities, the larger
the University of Chile, open also to women, and the Catholic
University, each with various departments; a National
Institute or high school, a School of Mines, a Normal
School, a School of Arts and Trades. In La Serena and
Copiapó at the north are other Mining Schools, and in
cities at the south Schools of Agriculture; also Normal
Schools. An Industrial College is to be opened in Valparaiso.
All towns have elementary schools; in all State
schools including universities education is free, and in
primary grades from 1921 compulsory. There are various
private schools, in Santiago a large and excellent one for
boys (managed for years by American Methodists), where
the sons of many prominent families have been educated,
as in La Paz, Bolivia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Press, Religion, etc.</span></h4>

<p><b>Press.</b> The Press is free, influential, and of high character,
the <i>Mercurio</i> of Valparaiso and Santiago having a
world wide reputation, and ranking with the best of any
country. There are about 700 newspapers and journals.</p>

<p><b>Religion.</b> The Roman Catholic religion is recognized
as that of the State, but freedom is permitted to others.
The women generally are very devout, though as in the
other countries the men of the governing classes are inclined
to agnosticism.</p>

<p><b>Telegraph.</b> Chile possesses 30,000 miles of telegraph
lines and 46,000 of telephone. There are 32 wireless stations
at intervals from Arica down to Punta Arenas, with one on
Juan Fernandez Island.</p>

<p><b>Money.</b> A gold peso (there are no such coins) may be
regarded as worth 36 cents, but the paper money which is
in general use fluctuates in value, a peso varying from 14
to 25 cents, usually 18-22. There are silver coins of 10, 20,
40 centavos, and copper of smaller value.</p>

<p>The <b>Metric System</b> of weights and measures is obligatory,
all others being excluded by law.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX<br><span class="small">CHILE: PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The country of Chile has an extraordinary shape, very
long and narrow. Unlike the other Republics of the West
Coast, Chile has no trans-Andine region, as the watershed
of the Andes constitutes the eastern boundary line. Thus
confined between the sea and the mountain tops, while the
coast line of the country is nearly 2700 miles, as far as from
Labrador to Guiana, the width is scanty, mostly varying
from 100 to 225 miles, though at one point in the south
the western boundary of Argentina is but 26 miles from the
Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Although so narrow for most of the distance, Chile has
three sections longitudinally: a very narrow coastal strip,
a plateau, or a central valley, and the mountain region. Its
remarkable length from 18° S. Lat., several degrees in the
torrid zone, to 56°, well towards the Antarctic Circle, gives
it a wide range in climate arising from the latitude, as well
as the variation from the altitude which it shares with the
countries previously mentioned. From north to south also,
the Republic has three zones: the hot arid land at the north,
18°-32°, followed by the temperate agricultural section in
the centre to 42°, and the cool, rainy, forested lands at the
south; sometimes four sections are spoken of, in which case
the first is regarded as two, dividing at 27° into the nitrate
section north and a mineral, south. Of these two the former
has a plateau section between the Andes and the sea, the
latter some transverse ridges. The country has 25 per cent
in woods and forests, 7¹⁄₂ per cent in pastures, 5 irrigable
land and 12¹⁄₂ per cent arable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>As already noted, the Pacific Coast south of Ecuador is
a practically rainless desert for a distance of 1600 miles
along the shore of Peru and Chile, about as far as Coquimbo.
Here begins the agricultural centre of Chile, including the
rich longitudinal valley (with soil 330 feet deep), in which
the capital, Santiago, is situated; the valley extends from
the Aconcagua River to the Gulf of Ancud, 620 miles. Many
populous towns and ports are in this section, among them
Valparaiso. The forest country farther south is but sparsely
settled.</p>

<p><b>Mountains.</b> The Cordillera of the Andes, which extends
throughout the entire length of the country, and is continued
at the north by the Cordillera of Peru, is recognized
from its geological formation as belonging to a recent epoch.
It contains many volcanoes, mostly extinct or inactive except
in the south. Aconcagua, of volcanic origin, the highest
peak of the Andes and of all America so far as is yet
known, is a little north of the centre. Its summit is just
over the border in Argentina, as the watershed forming the
boundary here runs west of the line of greatest altitude.
The height of Aconcagua is variously stated, but 22,817 feet
has perhaps the best authority. Other lofty peaks are near,
Mercedario and Tupungato, each over 22,000 feet. There
are 24 passes across the range at a height of 10,000 feet more
or less. Farther south the mountains diminish rapidly in
height with few summits above 10,000 feet. The range ends
in Tierra del Fuego with Mt. Sarmiento, 7000 feet.</p>

<p>A cordillera of the coast, geologically older, is much
lower, disappearing altogether at the north. In general
quite steep towards the sea, it slopes gradually towards the
central valley or plateau. This range continues at the south
in islands, which in great numbers fringe the coast. Here
the shore is much indented with straits and bays, resembling
the fjords of Norway. Nearly all of the narrowing
point of the continent, the entire Strait of Magellan, and
most of Tierra del Fuego belong to Chile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Rivers</span></h4>

<p>The rivers of the country are numerous except in the
north, where but two reach the ocean. Farther south to
35° they are torrential in character, but important both for
irrigation and as a potential source of hydro-electric power;
their descent from so great a height indicating large future
possibilities. Beyond 35° a number of streams are navigable
for some distance for boats of light draught, 500 miles in
all, the Bio-Bio for 100 miles, the Maule for 75. South of
these rivers are many picturesque and important lakes close
to the Cordillera where they serve as great reservoirs for
the excessive precipitation of rain and snow on the west
side of the mountains. The largest are Lakes Rauco and
Llanquihue, with estimated areas respectively of 200 and
250 square miles. Lake Todos los Santos, 40 square miles,
described as of marvelous beauty, is northeast of Puerto
Montt among the Andean foothills, at a height of 500 feet.</p>

<p>The seaboard at the north, with few indentations, has in
consequence poor harbors, where landing in small boats
may occasionally be dangerous or impossible. In the far
south are sheltered harbors, but few cities requiring them.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Climate</span></h4>

<p>The climate of the country naturally is extremely varied.
In the northern section the immediate coast like that of
Peru is preserved from intense heat by the Antarctic current.
A little way back on the arid plateau the temperature
is excessive by day but cool at night. Going south from the
arid section the rainfall gradually increases until in the far
south there is too much. The central regions have a fair
supply with an excellent climate, mean annual temperatures
of 50°-60°. Farther south with rain 150-170 days in the
year, in some places 80-100 inches, the climate is less
agreeable. The winds are generally west, either a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
north or south. While the mean temperatures are fairly
low, the extremes are much less than at the same latitudes
in most parts of North America or on the East Coast of
Argentina. Even at the farthest south, at Punta Arenas,
the most southern city of the globe, the weather is never
so cold as often in the usual winters of New York or Boston.
Until recently suitable sanitation has been lacking in many
cities and the death rate has been high. Now the authorities
are alive to these matters and with the installation of
proper sewerage, already accomplished in Santiago and in
progress in other cities, the death rate is lower. In no
cities from Guayaquil south need any tourist be apprehensive
of danger.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX<br><span class="small">CHILE: CAPITAL, INDIVIDUAL PROVINCES, CITIES</span></h3>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Capital</span></h4>

<p><b>Santiago</b>, the capital, with 450,000 inhabitants, is the
fourth in population of the cities of South America, the first
three being Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo.
The city is finely located in the fertile Central Valley, on
the Mapocho River. Important as the Government and
social centre, it has much commercial activity. A little off
the direct Trans-Andine line between Valparaiso and
Buenos Aires, it is equally a terminus, as special cars run
to each city from Los Andes where they connect with the
narrower mountain railway. Santiago is the centre of the
north and south railway systems which traverse the country
almost from end to end.</p>

<p>A lack of first class hotels has been partially remedied
by the construction of a large one on modern lines, but
it may be said that in all of the capital cities and chief ports
of the West Coast additional accommodations of a higher
class are desirable. In Santiago important improvements
recently accomplished include the installment of a sewerage
system and the repavement of the principal streets. Electric
lights have long been enjoyed and an excellent system of
electric cars, one feature of which New York might imitate
to advantage, the numbering of the cars to indicate the
various routes. Santiago in addition to its delightful location
may well boast of its fine buildings, especially its Capitol,
the handsome opera house, and many fine residences;
still more of its parks, the far famed Santa Lucía, Parque<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
Cousiño, and the Quinta Normal; also of the Palace of Fine
Arts, and the Cemetery, especially beautiful in rose time.
Most of the streets are narrow, but there is one splendid
broad avenue, the Alameda or Avenida de Delicias with a
central parkway ornamented with statuary.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Provinces</span></h4>

<p>A brief review of the Provinces follows, beginning at the
north. Unless otherwise stated, the Provinces extend from the
coast back to the mountains, bordering at the east on Bolivia
or Argentina.</p>

<p><b>Tacna</b>, formerly a part of Peru, is still claimed by that
country, though in the possession of Chile. It is separated
by the Sama River from the Peruvian Province, Moquegua.
Largely mountainous, Tacna has many peaks above 18,000
feet; the two passes to Bolivia are about 14,000 feet. Of
500,000 acres of possible agricultural land about one tenth
is irrigated, the rest is desert. Alfalfa is the chief production;
beans and maize are important with other vegetables
and fruit. The leading export is sulphur.</p>

<p>The capital, Tacna, is a pleasant town, connected by rail
with the port of Arica, though it is not on the road to La
Paz. Arica, with a better harbor than most of the others,
is an important primary port where all steamers call, as it
is the terminus of the Arica-La Paz Railway; one of the
three Pacific outlets for Bolivia. New docks are to be
constructed.</p>

<p><b>Tarapacá</b> follows on the south, this Province containing
with other minerals, extensive, hot, arid plains with nitrate
fields. The sloping coastal section has two important ports,
Pisagua and Iquique, besides smaller ones exclusively for
the export of nitrates, in which the two named are chiefly
engaged.</p>

<p>Iquique, the capital and principal port, is of great commercial
importance for such export, and has very large imports<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
from the fact that these include all eatables as formerly
all drinkables, even water. Now the water comes in
pipes 150 miles from the mountains. The soil too was imported
for the few plazas and gardens existing, as nothing
will grow in the native soil. It is an enterprising community
with a good proportion of pleasant British homes, clubs,
theatres, etc.</p>

<p><b>Antofagasta</b> comes next, separated from Tarapacá by the
River Loa. On the east it has both Bolivia and a piece of
northern Argentina. The surface descends from the Andes
in a series of plateaus. Vegetation is scanty. This Province,
with Atacama on the south, shares in the activities of the
nitrate industry.</p>

<p>The capital city, Antofagasta, is 200 miles south of
Iquique, both ports having very poor harbors, though with
enormous commerce for places of their size. Antofagasta,
the terminus of a third railway from La Paz, the second in
Chile, has much Bolivian trade besides export of nitrates,
and lately from Chuquicamata of copper. The Province
contains other ports and cities of consequence, Taltal, Tocopilla,
Mejillones, etc.</p>

<p><b>Atacama</b> on the south borders exclusively at the east on
Argentina, which from here down forms the eastern boundary
of Chile. The surface of the Province is uneven, with
mountains, plateaus, and ravines; in the valleys of Huasco
and Copiapó there is some agriculture. Minerals, as gold,
silver, and copper receive attention.</p>

<p>Copiapó, the capital, is an important railway junction.</p>

<p><b>Coquimbo</b>, following, is a narrower Province, the mountains
and the Argentine boundary coming nearer the shore.
There are many lofty peaks at the east; and between spurs
running down to the coast are fertile, well watered valleys,
as we now come to the central section where with a mild
climate there is moderate rainfall. Cereals, fruit, wine, and
livestock are exported.</p>

<p>La Serena, the capital, is a pretty town, which has tramway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
connection with Coquimbo, a first class port, and a busy
city.</p>

<p><b>Aconcagua</b> is next, with the great peak of that name in
the range at the east. Some 15 miles south of the peak is
the Uspallata Pass, for many years the main commercial
highway between Chile and Argentina. By this Pass came
Almagro, and later a division of the army of San Martín;
another division by the pass of Los Patos, a little lower
and farther north, by which cattle are often driven into
Chile. The Province is chiefly agricultural and pastoral,
with crops of cereals, fruits, hemp, and tobacco. The finest
wine is produced; there are large herds of cattle; and copper
has some exploitation.</p>

<p><b>Valparaiso</b>, one of the two Provinces bordering on Aconcagua
at the south, is next to the smallest in the Republic,
and the first coming from the north which does not extend
across the country. With Aconcagua on the north it has Santiago
on the east and south. The surface is mountainous with
extensive valleys, the Coast Range here reaching a height of
7000 feet. Several rivers and a number of bays are among its
favorable features. With a mild climate and sufficient rain
agriculture is the principal industry aside from the commercial
interests of the chief port of the West Coast, Valparaiso.</p>

<p><b>Santiago</b>, south of Aconcagua and east of Valparaiso,
extends from Argentina on the east, south of Valparaiso to
the sea, and has the two Provinces of O’Higgins and Colchagua
on the south. The Central Valley, which occupies
a great part of its area, is here a broad plain, part of which
is well watered and fertile but with some sections arid;
the foothills and valleys are well wooded. The Central
Valley slopes towards the west, having an altitude of nearly
3000 feet at the foot of the Andes, and about 1000 feet near
the hills of the Coast Range. The highest point of the
Andes, here south of Mt. Aconcagua, is less than 20,000 feet
while the Coast Range approaches 8000. Cereals, vegetables,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
fruit, and wine are the chief products. Among other
towns in the Province is the port of San Antonio.</p>

<p><b>O’Higgins</b>, a very small Province, occupies what may be
called a jog at the southeast corner of Santiago, which is
therefore on the west and north, while Argentina is east
and Colchagua south. Although a rugged district, irrigation
is developed and large crops of cereals and fruit are
grown. Rich in mineral deposits, copper alone is exploited.</p>

<p><b>Colchagua</b>, south of Santiago and O’Higgins, extends
across the country from the sea to the mountains, which
have three easy passes into Argentina. The plains of the
Central Valley have a rich soil and good rainfall, but as the
summers are dry, as in Santiago, irrigation is needful. Crops
of wheat, beans, alfalfa, etc., are important, and also the
cattle industry.</p>

<p><b>Curicó</b> follows across the south with similar features and
productions.</p>

<p><b>Talca</b> is next, also extending from the coast to Argentina.
With a temperate climate, there are greater extremes
of heat and cold on the plain. Besides the agricultural and
cattle industries, the dense forests here afford opportunity
for exploitation. Two Provinces are on the south.</p>

<p><b>Linares</b>, the more eastern, has Argentina on the east,
Nuble south, and Maule west. With considerable agricultural
land, along the lower slopes of the Andes it has dense
woods.</p>

<p><b>Maule</b>, the coast Province south of Talca, has both
Linares and Nuble on the east, and Concepción south. The
valleys of the Coast Cordillera, which are fertile, afford
opportunity for increased agriculture, but unwise deforestation
has been injurious.</p>

<p><b>Nuble</b>, again an Andean Province, between Argentina
and Maule, is south of Linares and north of Concepción.
Easy passes lead into Argentina, forests are extensive, and
vines and cereals are grown on a large scale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p><b>Concepción</b>, south of Maule and Nuble, extends from the
Pacific to Argentina. Mountainous at the east, it is rather
arid in the centre, but extremely fertile near the coast. The
fine crops include grapes and excellent wine. Large forests
and extensive coal deposits are a source of wealth.</p>

<p><b>Arauco</b> and Bio-Bio are on the south; Arauco along the
coast, with important agriculture and large herds of cattle,
has also extensive forests and mineral deposits, coal mines
actively worked, and gold, both alluvial and quartz.</p>

<p><b>Bio-Bio</b> at the east is mountainous and well watered, as
is this region in general. Cereals are largely grown and
viticulture is practised. The cattle industry is important
and the forests are exploited.</p>

<p><b>Malleco</b>, south of Bio-Bio, is peculiar in the fact that it
alone of the Provinces touches neither the Pacific nor Argentina,
having a strip of Bio-Bio and Cautín on the east
and Arauco on the west. The mountainous eastern section
is heavily wooded and the fertile central plain with a mild
damp climate is celebrated for its crops of wheat.</p>

<p><b>Cautín</b>, extending all the way across the country, touches
three Provinces on the north, Arauco, Malleco, and Bio-Bio.
Here are plains, mountains, and valleys, with much rainfall
and luxuriant vegetation of forest, grass, and agriculture.
Excellent timber and tannin extracts, fruit and cattle, produce
wealth, and coal and gold await exploitation.</p>

<p><b>Valdivia</b>, south of Cautín, also extends across the country.
Here are lower mountains, many passes into Argentina,
extensive forests, several lakes, much rain; but a
healthful climate, luxuriant vegetation, with profitable agriculture,
forest products, and cattle breeding.</p>

<p><b>Llanquihue</b> follows, extending south to the Gulf of
Ancud and beyond. The present southern terminus of the
Longitudinal Railway is the capital, Puerto Montt, at the
head of the Gulf. This is largely a forest region, though
in the valley of the lakes are fertile lands suited to grazing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
and agriculture, both of which industries are increasingly
followed. The climate is rather cool but equable.</p>

<p><b>Chiloé</b>, the last of the Provinces, consists of the large
island of that name covering about 560 square miles, other
islands much smaller, and a long archipelago called Chonos
extending to the peninsula of Taitao. The island, Chiloé,
is largely covered with forests which, strange to say, have
a somewhat tropical character, with fine timber, dense
undergrowth, and trailing vines; for the climate, with excessive
rainfall, is extremely mild for the latitude, which
corresponds to that of Massachusetts. Cereals, potatoes,
and fruit are grown, and many pigs are raised; though
forestry, and fishing are of greater importance.</p>

<p><b>The Territory of Magallanes</b> extends from the 47th
parallel south including the mainland and islands, with
mountains, rivers, forest, and plains. On the coast the climate
is not severe; in the interior it is more rigorous. Cattle
and sheep raising are the most profitable industries;
whaling and forestry are important.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI<br><span class="small">CHILE: PORTS AND TRANSPORTATION</span></h3>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Ports</span></h4>

<p>Although Chile cannot boast of many excellent harbors,
with her extended coast line her ports are naturally numerous;
59 is the official number, of which 15 are primary
ports with custom houses, while the rest are dependent,
save Punta Arenas, which is proudly apart as a free port,
the only one in this part of the world. The primary ports
are not necessarily those with the best harbors, but were
made such on account of the demands of commerce.</p>

<p>The service along the coast is similar to that of Peru
except that the boats of the Peruvian Steamship Line do
not go beyond their own shores, while there is additional
service by Chilian steamers. Before the War 40 per cent
of the engaged shipping was British. Service to and from
Europe, formerly by way of the Straits, long ended at
Valparaiso, later extending to Callao, and for one or two
sailings to Panamá. The exigencies of war interfered with
the execution of plans which are now being carried out or
modified. European express service below Panamá is likely
to be confined to the ports of Callao, Mollendo, Arica,
Iquique, Antofagasta, Valparaiso, and Punta Arenas, with
a possible call for coal at Coronel. Other express service
may include Coquimbo and Talcahuano. Aside from the
leading coastal lines a few companies operate smaller ships
locally; on the sea, and 843 miles on the several navigable
rivers at the south. There is also service among the southern
islands and to Juan Fernandez, 400 miles to the west.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p><b>Valparaiso</b>, as the most important Pacific port south of
Panama, deserves especial attention. This rapidly growing
city, population about 200,000, to one coming from the north
seems quite European, with an atmosphere more crisp and
businesslike than that of courtly Lima or picturesque La
Paz. The semicircular bay is called a good harbor except
when the north winds blow, as they are liable to do in
winter. Some years ago a British steamer lying at anchor,
in an unusually strong blow was sunk with all on board.
A breakwater expected to avert such danger, has for some
time been in construction; but the depth of water off shore
has made the work difficult. Freight was formerly discharged
into lighters and people into rowboats, the steamers
anchoring at some distance from shore. Now, however, a
fiscal mole 100 feet long, one half with a depth of water of
43 feet, the rest of 36 feet, provides all facilities. Valparaiso
has fair hotels, providing insufficient accommodation for
the rapidly increasing travel and business. In many respects
the city is quite up to date, but unhappily here and in Santiago
Americans in winter suffer more with the cold when
sitting indoors than in La Paz and Lima, though for walking
outside it is comfortable enough with the temperature
near freezing. As a rule dwelling houses have no heating
apparatus, no stoves, but in some hotel dining rooms electric
heaters are employed, and oil stoves may be provided for
Americans in their rooms. While Chile has coal mines,
their production is insufficient for the use of shipping and
of their varied industries, and the people are not accustomed
to use either the native or the imported article for heating
purposes.</p>

<p>The business section of Valparaiso is on a narrow strip
of shore between the bay and the amphitheatre of hills, the
level sector varying in width from two blocks to half a mile.
Climbing up the slopes and crowning the hill tops is most
of the residential district. The business section, largely
destroyed by an earthquake in 1906, has been rebuilt in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
more substantial manner, and it well compares with other
cities of its size. Ascensors run by cable on inclined
planes are in general use for the ascent of the bluffs, though
paths and a few carriage roads wind steeply upward in the
cañons here and there separating the hills, some of which
rise to a height of 1000 feet. The suburb of Viña del Mar,
population 34,000, a fashionable summer resort with a fine
beach and club house, distant a half hour by rail, is much
frequented by the foreign devotees of golf, tennis, and other
athletic sports.</p>

<p><b>Other Ports.</b> Of the other principal ports we have
observed that Arica is the terminus of the Arica-La Paz
Railway, that Iquique is important for nitrates, Antofagasta
for nitrates, copper, and as the medium of commerce
with Bolivia by the old railway to Oruro and now to La
Paz; Coquimbo as the port of a province with both mineral
and agricultural wealth. Below Valparaiso are better
harbors. Concepción, the largest city south of Santiago,
350 miles distant, is spoken of as the outlet of the rich
Province of that name, but being 12 miles from the mouth
of the Bio-Bio River it is not a real seaport and is served
by Talcahuano, 9 miles away, which has one of the best
harbors on the coast. For this reason, though a much
smaller city, population 24,000, it was selected as a military
port and for the Government dry docks. A little farther
south on Arauco Bay are Coronel and Lota, both important
coaling stations, at one of which all steamers call; Lota,
the larger city, has all conveniences for shipping. At the
tip of the mainland in the Straits is Punta Arenas, not
visited by the regular coasting steamers, but a port where
every passing ship is likely to make a brief call.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Railways</span></h4>

<p>While the Chilians have always cultivated a taste for
the sea, for strategical more than commercial reasons railway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
construction has of late been strongly favored. In
this medium of traffic Chile in proportion to her area is
far ahead of the other West Coast countries. It is true
that the difficulties of topography are less. The oldest
existing line in Latin America was here constructed in 1849
by a Bostonian, William Wheelright, who later founded the
Pacific Steam Navigation Company, the earliest giving
regular steamship service to Europe from the West Coast.
This first railway line was from the port Caldera to the
mining town Copiapó. The line from Valparaiso to Santiago,
also constructed by Americans, was finished in 1863.
Government ownership is popular in Chile, and of the 8000
miles of road in operation the State owns over 5000, with
considerable extensions planned. Unfortunately six different
gauges have been used, varying from 2 feet 6 inches
on the Antofagasta Bolivia Line to 5 feet 6 inches on the
Central Railway.</p>

<p><b>The Central Railway.</b> This is a Government Line connecting
Valparaiso with the capital Santiago, express trains
with American parlor cars making the run of 117 miles in
four hours. The road is now to be electrified. South along
the rich Central Valley, the same Railway runs through
sleeping cars to Valdivia and to Puerto Montt, the latter
city 750 miles from Santiago. This section is well worth
a visit, whether from a scenic or a business point of view.
A bridge 1400 feet long and 300 above the bed of the Malleco
River cost over $1,000,000.</p>

<p>There are many branches from the main line, some of
these privately owned; most of them to coast ports, a few
towards the Cordillera. Valdivia is the most southern
ocean port to which a branch extends. Farther north, the
third city of Chile, Concepción, is favored, and Talcahuano
near by. From Concepción a coast road leads south to
Lota, Coronel, and beyond. From Talca a line goes to
Constitución, of some importance for agriculture, shipyards,
and gold mining. Another branch goes to the port Pichilemu;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
from Santiago one extends 72 miles to the port San
Antonio, nearer the capital than is Valparaiso but a secondary
port to be improved by the building of docks. The
Central Railway obviously forms a very important part of
the real longitudinal railway, but the section which has the
name Longitudinal begins farther north.</p>

<p>The <b>South Longitudinal</b>. From Calera on the Valparaiso-Santiago
Railway a branch leads 45 miles to Cabildo,
where begins the Longitudinal proper. This because of construction
difficulties is of narrow gauge, one metre. On account
of poor equipment and service, and the competition of
steamship lines along the coast, its traffic is at present
small; but with better facilities and increase of population
it will be of much value. At last accounts there was weekly
service to Antofagasta with two changes of cars, not counting
the one from Valparaiso or Santiago in order to reach
Cabildo. Here, three hours from Santiago, the South
Longitudinal is taken to the city of Copiapó; for the Longitudinal
has two sections. The ride is through a fairly pleasant
country with varied scenery, the region being partly agricultural
and partly mineral. In this section are heavy grades,
rising to 6 per cent, requiring 28 miles of the rack system.
Branches or other connecting lines here and there reach the
sea. The road passes through the important port Coquimbo,
and the adjoining Serena, at which point, 200 miles from
Valparaiso, the desert land begins; though in river valleys
there is still some verdure. From Vallenar on the main
line a branch runs 31 miles to the port Huasco. A private
line from the port Carrizal, 92 miles north of Huasco and
73 south of Caldera, crosses the Longitudinal. At Copiapó
we come to the old line from Caldera, a fairly good port,
shipping copper and doing considerable other business,
though not a port of the first class. A branch in the other
direction extends to San Antonio.</p>

<p>The <b>North Longitudinal</b>. At Copiapó we change to the
North Longitudinal from which there is a branch to Chañaral,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
about 50 miles north of Caldera, on a large but exposed
bay in one of the richest mineral districts of Atacama, with
large smelting works, and exporting gold, silver, and copper.
A private (British) railway system of 184 miles, crossing
the Longitudinal, serves a nitrate district and the port
of Taltal, 100 miles south of Antofagasta; a primary port
on a well protected bay, with piers fitted with steam cranes,
a centre of the nitrate and copper industries. Taltal is a
modern town with important business houses. Besides
gold, silver, and copper, the Province has some undeveloped
nitrate land.</p>

<p>Farther on at Aguas Blancas, a railway belonging to
the Bolivia-Antofagasta Company runs to Caleta Coloso,
a port six miles south of Antofagasta and connected by rail
with that city as well as with various nitrate properties.
Farther still the Longitudinal crosses the Antofagasta-Bolivia
Railway at Baquedano, where some traffic is exchanged.
It is the intention of the Government to construct
its own line to Antofagasta and to the port of
Mejillones some miles north. Beyond this crossing, from
Toco on the Longitudinal, the Anglo-Chilian Nitrate and
Railway Company’s Line branches to the port of Tocopilla.
At last Pintados, the one time terminus is reached, where
connection is made with the Nitrate Railways, which go
on to Iquique and Pisagua. But in spite of this the Government
Line is now being prolonged to the former city.
It is intended ultimately to extend the main line to Arica,
175 miles farther, a section likely to be unprofitable commercially
but desired for other reasons. From Arica there
is a railway to Tacna, near the Peruvian border, hence on
completion of this section there would be through rail service
from near the northern border to Puerto Montt in the
far south, a primary port on the Gulf of Reloncavi. The
length of the road from Puerto Montt to Jazpampa the
present terminus, east of Pisagua, is 1902 miles; to Taratá,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
the most northern town in the mountains, the distance is
207 miles more.</p>

<p>The <b>Antofagasta-Bolivia Railway</b>. The Bolivian section
of the important Antofagasta Railway has already been
referred to. That in Chile deserves further consideration.
British owned, like most of the Chilian railways not belonging
to the State, it is the longest and most important of
these. Although uncommonly narrow with a 2 foot 6 inch
gauge, the sleeping cars are more comfortable than some
with double the width. The road operates 835 miles of main
track to La Paz, 518 of these in Chile. There is semi-weekly
service to La Paz in practically two days, besides
local trains. One thousand, two hundred and fifty miles of
track are controlled by the Company. The climb begins at
once, the road in 18 miles getting 1800 feet above the sea.
At km. 36 a branch 70 miles long goes to the Boquete
Nitrate Fields, altitude 5622 feet. At Prat, km. 59, a branch
goes down to Mejillones, a new port, opened by the Company
in 1906, called the finest harbor on the coast, capable
of holding the fleets of the world (it was said when these
were smaller) and so protected that shipping suffers no
inconvenience from bad weather. Tocopilla, 37 miles north
of Antofagasta, has direct rail connection with that city
by a line 43 miles long. The main Antofagasta line, crossing
the Longitudinal at km. 96, at km. 116 enters the
principal nitrate district of this region and leaves it 35
miles beyond. In this section are 24 <i>oficinas</i>, as the nitrate
plants are called, some of them models of their kind.</p>

<p>Going in either direction this part is traversed at night;
otherwise one might be refreshed by the sight of a little
green at Calama, 149 miles from Antofagasta, at six <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>
This was a copper mining centre in Inca days and a smelter
is here now. At this altitude some persons stop a day, a
good plan if one is not sure of his heart; though oxygen
is now carried for use in emergency. At km. 254 is a short
branch, 6 miles, to Chuquicamata, to be referred to later.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
Just beyond the Conchi station is a graceful viaduct with
six lattice girder spans of 80 feet each, supported on steel
trestle towers. This, called the highest viaduct in the world,
is 336 feet above the water of the Rio Loa, at an altitude
of nearly 10,000 feet. Here a branch line runs to the copper
mines of Conchi Viejo. At San Pedro station, 195 miles,
at 10,600 feet altitude, are reservoirs blasted from the solid
rock, on which the Company spent $6,000,000 to supply
Antofagasta, the nitrate fields, and the railway with water.
The water comes from three different places, one of them
37 miles northeast and 14,500 feet above the sea: this
source capable of supplying 6000 tons of water daily through
11-inch pipes.</p>

<p>The road now passes two snow capped volcanoes, from
one of which smoke may be rising, and crosses a stream of
lava one-third of a mile wide and several miles long, to the
summit of the main line, 13,000 feet. Soon after, a borax
lake belonging to a British company may be seen; 24 miles
long, it is the largest single deposit in the world and the
chief source of the world’s supply. At Ollague, where snow
storms occasionally impede traffic, is a branch to the rich
copper mines at Collahuasi. The Bolivian frontier is soon
afterward crossed, and at Uyuni a change is made to the
broader gauge line to La Paz.</p>

<p>The <b>Trans-Andine Railway</b>. Of all the railroads of
Chile, the Trans-Andine is naturally the most famous, as a
part of the only trans-continental railway south of Panama;
but financially, as yet it is hardly a success. With post-war
increase of traffic, there will doubtless be an improvement.
The Trans-Andine section of metre gauge begins at
Los Andes, altitude 2723 feet, 88 miles from Valparaiso.
A change is here made from the State Line, 5.5-foot gauge.
It is a distance of 43 miles to the tunnel, a steep climb up
the Aconcagua River Valley, with a maximum grade of
8 per cent; 20 miles of rack railway are employed. There
are 25 tunnels, and on the Aconcagua River or its branches,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
118 bridges. The scenery is wild and the journey delightful.
Sheds have been erected against snow and land slides.
Up to 1916 the road was closed for several months each
winter; but with an increase of sheds and with a force of
men continually digging, the road was kept open through
the years 1916, ’17 and ’18; it was seriously blocked in
July, 1919. While previously passenger traffic was the more
remunerative, in 1916 unusual efforts were made for the
benefit of important freight which it was impossible to ship
by sea.</p>

<p>The tunnel is at a height of 10,486 feet, its length is
10,385 feet, each practically two miles. The boundary line
is near the middle, each country building to that point; but
the whole is operated as one line from Los Andes to Mendoza.
The line was opened in the Centennial year, April
16, 1910, in time for the Exposition at Buenos Aires. The
cost of the Chilian section was about $15,000,000. Operation
is at a loss, interest being paid by the Government.
The capitalization is $317,000 a mile. Fifteen Trans-Andine
projects have been put forward, most of them for the south,
one from near Puerto Montt. One in construction is from
Talcahuano to Bahia Blanca by way of Temuco. A road
from Punta Arenas to the Loreto coal fields is the most
southern railway in the world, as that is the most southern
city. The early construction is expected of an important
road at the north from Salta in Argentina by Huaytiquina
on the border to Antofagasta. Of wagon roads there are
said to be 20,000 miles.</p>

<p>The Arica-La Paz Railway is described on page 222.</p>

</div>


<p>Although Chile is often compared to California, to which
State it has some but not a close resemblance in length,
partial dryness, earthquakes, and fruit, the specialty of
Chile is not shared by California. Chile and nitrates are
almost synonymous terms. A thought of one suggests the
other. The greater part of the nitrate country earlier belonged
to Peru, some also to Bolivia; and both countries still
bewail their loss.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Mining</span></h4>

<p>The <b>Nitrate Fields</b> we know are in the north, chiefly
in the Provinces of Tarapacá, Antofagasta, and Atacama.
If this desert land does not blossom as the rose, it produces
the wherewithal to make other fields blossom, and the
wealth to purchase the roses. The richest deposits are
mainly along a stretch of 300 miles from Pisagua in Tarapacá,
to Coquimbo. With an average width of 2¹⁄₂ miles,
the fields are at a distance of from 10 to 80 miles back from
the coast, and at a height of 2000-5000 feet. The deposits,
which are not in continuous fields, are sometimes on the
surface, but oftener overlaid with strata of earth several
feet thick. The raw material called <i>caliche</i> contains from
20 to 65 per cent nitrate of soda. After pickling in tanks
8-12 hours, the liquid, <i>caldo</i>, is run off, the sand and refuse
dropping to the bottom. When ready for export the article
carries 15-16 per cent nitrogen and 36 per cent sodium.
Commercial nitrate is a white cheese-like substance, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
is used in manufacturing the highest grade of gunpowder,
also to produce nitric and sulphuric acid; but the bulk of
it in ordinary times is employed as a fertilizer, doubling
and tripling the harvest. Within recent years the demand
and in consequence the production has greatly varied, the
partial recovery in 1920 being soon followed by a depression.</p>

<p>A by-product is a yellow liquid, which being chemically
treated leaves a blue crystal, iodine, which costs as much
an ounce as saltpetre per 100 pounds. Being worth $700-$800
a cask it is shipped in treasure vaults with bullion.
The nitrate establishments called <i>oficinas</i> provide good salaries,
and the best possible quarters for their officials, and they are
interesting to visit. As a mineral, the nitrate is distinguished
from guano although believed by some to have the same origin.
British companies have long been engaged in this industry.
American interests have more recently acquired holdings. The
Du Ponts have three properties covering 14,000 acres.</p>

<p>The chief ports of this region are Iquique and Antofagasta,
Pisagua being a smaller port visited only by the
<i>caletero</i> or the strictly freight boats. Iquique is a more agreeable
city than in former days, when water was sometimes $2
a gallon, and people drank champagne, they said, because
water was too expensive. Now the dust of the streets is laid
by sprinklers, some people have bath rooms, a few even fountains
in patios. Antofagasta is also a desert place, unattractive
to look at, but with good shops, business houses, and fair
hotels. The water comes a distance of nearly 200 miles, the
source more than two miles above the sea.</p>

<p><b>Potash.</b> In addition to nitrates Chile possesses extensive
beds of useful potash one of which is estimated to contain
nearly 7,000,000 tons easy of exploitation.</p>

<p><b>Copper.</b> The property of the Chile Copper Company
(one of the Guggenheim interests) at Chuquicamata is
said to be the largest copper deposit known in the world.
About 2000 of the 9600 acres of the claim are mineralized.
The outcrop of copper is one and a half miles in length.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
It has been proved below to a width of 1800 feet and a
length of 7500 feet. Ten of the 2080 shafts are over 1000
feet in depth, and at 1500 feet the ore is of commercial
value. Over 700,000,000 tons of positive and probable ore
have been developed, carrying an average value of 2.12 per
cent copper. The reduction plant has a capacity of 15,000
tons a day, the refinery of 180,000,000 pounds a year. With
a 90 per cent extraction the yield is 96 pounds of copper
per ton. At the port of Tocopilla, north of Antofagasta,
the Company has a power station where oil from California
is used to generate a power of 24,000-27,000 kilowatts
needed at Chuquicamata. This is transported by wire
across country a distance of 100 miles. At normal prices
the cost of copper production with delivery in New York
or Europe is $121 a ton, or about 6 cents a pound; higher
with war time conditions which still obtain (1921). From
the 15,000 ton plant in full service 175,000,000 pounds of
copper would be produced annually. In 1920, 55,617,000
pounds were produced, the largest amount from any mine
in Chile. In 1916 important mines belonging to the Calama
Mining Company were added to the Chile Company’s holdings.</p>

<p>The Braden Copper Company, another Guggenheim
interest, owns about 2300 acres in the Province of O’Higgins.
They have a concentrator, a smelting and converting
plant, a hydro-electric power plant with 800 kilowatt
capacity and an electric and a steam railway; the latter,
43 miles long, connecting the property with Rancagua,
which is on the Central Railway 43 miles southeast of Santiago.
The ore is of concentrating copper, a sulphide in
brecciated andesite, around an extinct volcano. It runs
about 2.5 per cent, with an earlier production cost in New
York of 6.5 cents a pound, but now higher. In 1916, 1500-1800
men were employed. The plant, recently enlarged,
is not working to capacity. In 1917, 64,000,000 pounds were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
produced, over 77,000,000 in 1918, with diminishing demand,
40,000,000 in 1920.</p>

<p>Another American syndicate has acquired the Tamaya
Copper Mines in the Province of Coquimbo between Ovalle
and Tongoy, the latter, a minor port 27 miles south of
Coquimbo, sheltered from north winds, with smelting works
in the place. With an efficient pumping plant and other
improvements installed, the mines are expected to yield
large production. Other companies, native, British, and
French are engaged in copper mining at Carrizal and elsewhere.</p>

<p><b>Iron.</b> Coquimbo, a Province with local importance for
agriculture, is notable for its deposits of iron ore, said to
amount to a billion tons. Only one of these has been
worked, a deposit located at Tofo, about four miles east of
Cruz Grande, and 30 north of the city of Coquimbo. This
property was leased in 1913 by the Bethlehem Steel Company
from a French Company which had developed the
mine to some extent and produced ore. The ore appearing
as the top of a large hill will be mined by electric shovels
and transported by an electric railway to docks at Cruz
Grande. The amount of ore is very large though with
exact tonnage undetermined. The Company is still exploring
the deposit at depth.</p>

<p>The mines and railway are completely equipped. At
Cruz Grande a basin dock has been constructed with large
storage pockets into which the ore will be discharged from
the railway cars, and from which it will go directly into
the vessels. The Steel Company is constructing steamers
of 20,000 tons to carry the ore to the United States for use
in their furnaces. The ore is very pure averaging about
67.50 per cent iron. It is a dense ore reddish black in color,
a mixture of magnetite and hematite.</p>

<p>The French Company formerly controlling Tofo had
erected a steel plant at Corral intending to transport the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
ore thither. There is no iron ore near there and the plant
is not operating.</p>

<p>Of the other deposits in Coquimbo and farther north
some are of considerable size, but none is located so near
the coast as Tofo and none has been developed.</p>

<p><b>Other metals</b> existing in Chile are at present of less
importance and slight operation. A moderate gold output
accompanies the production of copper, and there is some
placer mining, especially in the south. Deposits are known
to exist in many Provinces from Tacna to Tierra del Fuego.
Silver too exists, but its production is chiefly as a by-product.
Lead, zinc, molybdenum, and tungsten are exported
in limited quantities.</p>

<p><b>Coal</b>, following nitrates, is of the first importance among
ordinary minerals, a source of large wealth though the production,
about 1,700,000 tons yearly, is insufficient for the
needs of the country. Little is therefore exported and a
good deal is normally imported from Great Britain and
Australia; until recently a little only from the United
States. Most of the mines in operation, owned by ten companies,
are near the ports of Talcahuano, Coronel, and Lota.
The coal is not equal in quality to the British, but it has
been used by steamships, railways, and mines with fair
results. Coronel or Lota, five miles apart on Arauco Bay,
one or the other, is a regular port of call for steamships.
The Cousiño property at Lota was purchased in 1852 and
later was conducted by the son’s widow, under her administration
the greatest financial enterprise carried on by a
Chilian. At her death she was called the richest woman
in the world, leaving a property of $70,000,000. The capital
of the company is $20,000,000. The mines are one-fourth of
a mile deep and extend under the sea, where there is good
rock and no drip. Here are streets, restaurants, offices,
stalls for horses, blacksmith shops, etc.</p>

<p>A British Company, the Arauco, in addition to coal
properties operates its own railway with 62 miles of main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
line and branches, besides mining spurs. It has four daily
trains from Concepción to Lota, Coronel, and beyond, passing
over the Bio-Bio River by a bridge of 1¹⁄₄ miles, the
longest in South America. Of coal about 1¹⁄₂ million tons
are produced and as much more is imported.</p>

<p><b>Petroleum</b> is believed by Chilians to exist in large quantities,
but the present development is infantile. It has been
found in southern Chile, on the Island of Chiloé and in the
Patagonas district, as well as in the north near the Bolivian
frontier. Large quantities are imported principally from
Peru, normally about 400,000 tons a year. Oil recently
found in the Magallanes Territory is stated by experts to
be equal in quality to that found in Argentina. The extent
of the deposits seems to rival that of the famous fields of
Comodoro Rivadavia. Legislation to regulate the well
drilling is proposed to prevent inundation of deposits by
subterranean streams, to restrict the ownership to native
Chilians or foreigners with Chilian families, and to secure
to the Government a 10 per cent royalty. A strong flow
of petroleum of great purity from a well about 300 feet
deep has recently been reported from Chiloé.</p>

<p><b>Sulphur</b> comes from a largely producing mine at the foot
of Mt. Ollague, and from one of growing importance at
Tacora on the Arica-La Paz Railway. The deposits of
Tacora are believed to contain 10 to 45 million tons of
sulphur. In 1915 about 10,000 tons were produced in Chile.</p>

<p><b>Salt.</b> From various salt deposits, the salinas of Punta
de Lobos and several mountain lagoons, about $300,000
worth of salt was produced, supplying the domestic market.</p>

<p><b>Borax</b> is important, Chile furnishing about half of the
world supply.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Agriculture</span></h4>

<p>Of large importance and value are the agricultural interests
including fruit, although the imports of such products<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
are nearly double the exports in value. About one eighth
of the area of Chile consists of arable land. The production
should be greatly increased. Twenty million acres are still
available, and with better methods excellent results might
be secured. In 1914-15 about 25,000,000 bushels of wheat
were raised, half as many potatoes, and more than half as
much hay; besides barley, oats, beans, corn, etc. Considerable
wheat is exported with some barley, oats, rye, and
legumes. Of 15,000,000 acres suitable for wheat, only one
fifth is in cultivation. It grows well from Aconcagua to
Cautín inclusive, but farther south the crops are uncertain.
They average 15-20 bushels an acre. Six hundred thousand
acres are devoted to alfalfa, which in favorable places gives
three crops a year and has roots ten feet long, a distinctive
variety being formed here. In irrigated valleys from
Coquimbo north, corn gives two fine crops annually. Potatoes
flourish from Concepción south, in Chiloé yielding 250-350
bushels to the acre. Flax and sugar beets might be
raised. Some agricultural machines are now employed, in
the neighborhood of 30,000.</p>

<p><b>Fruit.</b> Delicious fruits of all temperate zone varieties
and some of the subtropical are raised, chiefly for home consumption,
but with export possibilities. Drying and canning
of these is practised to some extent, but might be done on
a much larger and more profitable scale. Excellent table
grapes are raised; many vineyards devote their product to
wine making, the industry being especially developed in
the Provinces of Santiago, O’Higgins, and Colchagua. In
the north, wine is made of the port and sherry classes; in
the central section light wines of excellent quality, some of
which are exported to the neighboring countries. More wine
however is imported of expensive varieties. The vineyards
are in general owned by natives, and according to location
are worth $200-$1000 an acre. Raisins are produced in
quantity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Forestry</span></h4>

<p>This might become a more important industry, though
now practised to a considerable extent. It has been customary
to burn a section of forest at the close of summer,
February, to get rid of the underbrush, and later to cut
down the trees, which must have suffered some injury. The
forest area is below the Bio-Bio River. On a tract of 100
square miles extending from near Valdivia north to Temuco,
the timber averages about 9000 feet to the acre. Farther
south the woods are denser, as on the Island of Chiloé.
The greatest extent of forest is in Valdivia, the next in
Llanquihue and in Chiloé. On this Island a 60 mile railway
was constructed by the Government from Ancud at the
northwest to Castro south, on the east side, making a part
of the forest accessible. Oak, Chilian mahogany, laurel,
ash, pine, and other hard and soft woods are available.
There are in Chile 3000 saw-mills and some pulp and shingle
mills. The first and second grades of wood, used for floors
and finished boards, bring $12-$18 per 1000 feet, ash $25;
the third grade is worth $8. Shingles are $3 per thousand.
From the forests comes the <i>quillay</i> bark with a soapy substance
for cleaning silk and fine linen, of which $200,000
worth is annually exported to France, after being prepared
by two Chilian factories. Tannin, of which 15,000 tons are
annually used, is derived from bark of several kinds. With
additional railways planned and Government data furnished,
there is opportunity for good investments with moderate
capital.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Stock Raising</span></h4>

<p>Stock raising of various kinds is carried on quite extensively
by some large companies under British, German, or
Chilian control, often paying 20 per cent dividends. Sheep
are in the lead, numbering probably 6,000,000, cattle 3,000,000,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
horses 725,000, half as many goats, a third as many pigs,
fewer donkeys, mules, alpacas, and llamas. The horses are
good, larger than those in Peru, and noted for their excellent
trotting, some making this as easy as a good pace or canter.
In 1916, 20,000,000 pounds of wool were produced, half of
this in Magallanes Territory not far from Punta Arenas, where
there are more than 3,000,000 sheep. The meat is of the finest
quality; the farther south the better the wool in thickness and
length of staple.</p>

<p>The cattle are improving with the introduction of Shorthorns
and Herefords; there is some export, especially to
Bolivia. The 3,000,000 at present might be increased ten fold.
A British company is constructing a frigorifico at Puerto
Montt. The dairy industry is important, with good cheese,
bottled milk, and some condensed. Goats are numerous in
the mountains. Apiculture is practised and fine honey is made.
Fisheries are of great importance and value, at Juan Fernandez,
as also along the coast.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Manufacturing</span></h4>

<p>Such industries are more developed in Chile than in any
of the countries previously considered. The 6200 manufactories
with 80,000 operatives and an investment of $250,000,000
show great diversity. There are saw mills, flour mills, breweries,
sugar refineries, some coarse sugar being imported from
Peru, tanneries, furniture, and shoe factories, with others
commonly found. A cement factory pays a quarterly dividend
of 5 per cent, a brewery gave a semi-annual dividend of 15
per cent. A new one is planned for Arica. More than $12,000,000
are invested in the leather industries, with an output
worth $20,000,000. Twenty-two or more shoe factories
are scattered in various cities. Clothing and textiles are next
in value of production, followed by $10,000,000 worth of
furniture and woodwork. Ship building is important.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Investments</span></h4>

<p>Activities in Chile in the immediate future for which about
$15,000,000 have been appropriated by the Government include
work or equipment on railways, roads, bridges, barracks,
waterworks, sewer systems, building construction, and port
works. These furnish opportunities to which many others
may be added. The possibilities in agriculture, fruit raising
and canning are obvious; those in fisheries, saw mills and
lumber, development of water power, in factories of various
kinds may be noted, as well as for large capitalists in mining.
A $10,000,000 contract for the electrification and equipment
of four zones of the Government railways has been concluded
with a combination of several American interests.</p>

POPULATION, ETC.</span></h3>
</div>


<p>Argentina, from the south the first country on the
Atlantic coast, the second largest in South America, has
been called not only the most progressive on that continent
but the richest per capita on the globe.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Area, Population, Boundary</span></h4>

<p><b>Area.</b> Occupying the greater part of the southern extremity
of the continent, Argentina is nearly 2300 miles
long, with an extreme width just south of Paraguay of 930
miles. Nearly as broad in the centre, the country below the
Province of Buenos Aires narrows rapidly towards the
south. Extending from 22° to 56° S. Lat., it has an area
of 1,154,000 square miles, equal to about one-third of Europe
and more than one-third of the United States: approximately
that of the part east of the Mississippi River with
Texas in addition.</p>

<p><b>Population.</b> In 1919 the inhabitants were reckoned as
over 8,000,000. In 1921 there may be 9,000,000, at least
8,500,000; more than seven to a square mile. Ninety per
cent of the population is found in 40 per cent of the territory,
although the rest may be the richest.</p>

<p><b>Boundary.</b> While boundary disputes have occurred with
her neighbors as in the case of the other South American
countries, all of Argentina’s have been amicably settled by
arbitration or agreement. Bolivia and Paraguay, a trifle of
Brazil and of Uruguay are on her northern border, the last
three are on the east; a long stretch of the Atlantic Ocean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
is at the southeast; at the south is a bit of Chile, which
country extends along the entire western boundary.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">History</span></h4>

<p>While a few settlements were made in Argentina (the
country was discovered in 1508) from a half to a whole century
earlier than those of our own coast cities, the country
was so hampered by restrictions of immigration and commerce,
exceeding those placed on the West Coast, that its growth
was stifled. After proclaiming independence it suffered for
years from internal disorders, but during the last half century
its development has been phenomenal. In 1535, the same year
that Pizarro founded Lima, Pedro de Mendoza landed on the
south shore of La Plata River and made at Buenos Aires the
first settlement on this part of the continent. But the Indians
of the East Coast were more savage than most of those on the
West, and a few years later, after many colonists had been
killed, the little town was abandoned. In 1580 it was re-established
by Juan de Garay, after a number of settlements
had been made in other districts, as at Mendoza, Santiago,
Tucumán, and Córdoba. Previously attached to the great
dominion ruled from Peru, in 1776 a Viceroyalty was established
at Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>In 1806-07, during a European war, the city was attacked
by British forces which were ultimately obliged to retreat. By
reason of this success the colonists became more self reliant,
and May 25th, 1810, they formed a junta of citizens who took
from the Viceroy the control of the Government. While this
was done in the name of Ferdinand VII, the date is regarded
as the birth of their independence. July 9th, the date of the
Proclamation of Independence by an Argentine Congress in
1816, is alike celebrated. Not being at first obliged to fight
a Spanish army in Argentina, some of the colonists under
General San Martín kindly assisted in liberating Chile and
later Peru from the Spanish yoke. Meanwhile Congress having
declared independence had made Buenos Aires the seat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
of government. Yet during civil strife which for many years
continued, the Province of Buenos Aires was at one time an
independent State, separated from the Argentine Federation.
In 1861 matters were finally settled and reunion was established.
In the latter part of that decade occurred the Paraguayan
War, which was followed by some internal difficulties;
but with many able leaders, growth and prosperity
for the most part have since prevailed.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Government</span></h4>

<p>The Government of Argentina is that of a Federal rather
than a Centralized Republic, although in fact the President
has a preponderating influence, with certain rights of intervention
in the affairs of any Province. The constitution following
quite closely that of the United States, there are the three
usual branches. The President of the Republic, elected for
a term of six years, is not immediately eligible for reëlection.
Congress has a Senate of 30 members and a Chamber of
Deputies of 158.</p>

<p>The Provinces have each a Governor and a Legislative
Assembly of its own choosing. The Governors of Territories
are appointed by the President. A Territory has the privilege
of becoming a Province when it has 50,000 inhabitants, but
for some reason this right has not been exercised. The Federal
District, the City of Buenos Aires, is governed by a Mayor
and a Council elected by tax paying residents.</p>

<p>Male citizens have the right of suffrage at the age of 18.
The passage of a law, at the initiative of President Dr. Roque
Saenz Peña, made the exercise of the franchise obligatory
upon all native born citizens, and on foreigners after two years
of residence, thus inaugurating a great change. At the first
election under the new law in 1916, Dr. Hipolito Irigoyen of
the Radical Party was chosen President by the Electoral College,
the first person outside of the previously governing class
to be elected.</p>

<p>There are 14 Provinces corresponding to our States, and
10 Territories, besides the Federal District, Buenos Aires. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
best obtainable figures of the area and population of the
Provinces and Territories with those of the population and
altitude of their capitals follow. The Provinces are named
in order from the north across from west to east in four rows,
thus beginning at the northwest:</p>

<p>The Territories are four at the extreme north, and the
remaining six south of a line from Mendoza to the City of
Buenos Aires.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Population</span></h4>

<p>With an estimated population of at least 8,600,000, Argentina
suffered a large decrease in its previously great immigration,
as well as a considerable emigration, during the Great
War, which in other ways at first gravely interrupted its prosperity.
In the 50 years preceding 1912, over 4,000,000 immigrants
had entered the country, more than 3,000,000 remaining.
Of those entering, the Italians numbered over 2,000,000,
Spanish over 1,000,000; those of any other nationality except
200,000 French were each fewer than 100,000. The Negroes
and the Indians of earlier days, except perhaps 100,000 of the
latter in remote sections, have become assimilated or killed.
The Chaco Indians, it is said, are not difficult to domesticate,
especially the Tobas living near the Bermejo River. The
people are generally considered the most homogeneous of any
of the South American countries except Uruguay, as nearly
all are of European descent. Here as in Chile we observe
the effect of location in the temperate zone, all of the country
being so situated except a small section at the north.</p>

<p>A great preponderance of population is in the cities, one
fifth of the whole in the city of Buenos Aires. While the
people are proud of its greatness they have begun to realize
that this concentration is not for the general welfare. Forty-three
per cent of the urban and 25 per cent of the entire
population is said to be foreign born. Aside from the Capital
of the Republic, there are in the Province of Buenos Aires
five cities with a population above 50,000 and a dozen more
with over 30,000. In Buenos Aires there is a large social circle
of wealth and culture, as well as a laboring class with strong
radical elements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Education</span></h4>

<p>Education receives much attention and $25,000,000 are
annually devoted to this purpose. Primary education is free
and called compulsory. There are primary and secondary
schools, Universities, Normal Schools, Technical Colleges,
Schools Agrarian and Veterinary, of Viticulture, Mines, Arts,
and Music. The Universities are at Buenos Aires, La Plata,
Córdoba, Tucumán, and Santa Fé; there are three Schools of
Commerce at Buenos Aires, and one each at Rosario and Concordia.
In various towns are private schools, some English
and American. The schools generally are of high grade, and
it was said by a former Argentine Ambassador, corroborated by
other persons familiar with Buenos Aires, that their school
children knew more about the United States than most of our
business men and Members of Congress knew about Argentina.
Many of their school buildings, though usually smaller than
ours, are superior in architectural beauty.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Press, Religion, etc.</span></h4>

<p><b>Press.</b> As to the Press, Buenos Aires can boast of two
of the wealthiest and best newspapers in the world, the
<i>Prensa</i> and the <i>Nación</i>. Not many years ago, the <i>Prensa</i>
contained as many pages of telegraphic and cable dispatches
as any New York paper had columns, and articles superior
in literary and intellectual ability. It was pronounced by
some Europeans the best newspaper in the world. Buenos
Aires has other papers of almost equal merit, besides several
in English and in other foreign languages.</p>

<p><b>Religion.</b> In Religion there is entire freedom, but the
President must be of the Roman Catholic Church. One in
Buenos Aires no longer sees women with <i>manta</i> or lace
veil over their heads for church going as on the West
Coast.</p>

<p><b>Telegraph.</b> Argentina has about 45,000 miles of telegraph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
lines, ample cable connections, and a dozen or more
wireless stations. Telephones are in general use in all the
large cities and in many smaller places.</p>

<p><b>Money</b> current in Argentina is paper, with coins for
small change. A paper peso is equal to .44 of a gold peso,
which is a little less than an American dollar, 96.48 cents;
but for practical purposes except in large transactions a paper
peso may be reckoned as 44 cents.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV<br><span class="small">ARGENTINA: PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</span></h3>
</div>


<p>Argentina is oftenest thought of as a country of broad
plains, but while a large portion of the country is of this
character there are three distinct sections: the Mountains,
the Plateau, and the Plains, with several subdivisions.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Mountains</span></h4>

<p>We know that the Andes form the western boundary
of the country for the entire distance from north to south,
and that some of the loftiest summits including the highest,
Aconcagua, are in Argentine territory; but east of the great
Cordillera, which as already noted is less steep on this than
on the Chilian side, are other ranges of the same and other
systems. Two or three extend from the Bolivian plateau,
and farther down spurs run out from the main chain. In
Córdoba are three ranges separate from the Andes, with
one peak above 9000 feet; a peak in San Luis is over 7000.
Near the sea in the Province of Buenos Aires, are low
mountains, mere hills in comparison, one reaching a height
of 4000 feet; and in Misiones are spurs from the Brazilian
Coast Range, the highest a hill about 1300 feet.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Plateaus</span></h4>

<p>There are plateaus in the north among the mountains,
but the distinctive Plateau Region is in what used to be
called Patagonia, a name not so much employed in Argentina
as formerly. This section is arranged in terraces, falling
from the Andes to the east, the western part called the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
Plateau, having an altitude of 2000-500 feet; near the sea
it goes from the latter figure to sea level. The Plateau has
many sterile plains, some strewn with boulders, others with
dunes of sand; also good grazing and forest land, and some
suitable for farming.</p>

<p><b>Lakes.</b> The Andine lakes in the Patagonia section are
of glacial origin, with much scenic beauty. One of these,
Nahuel-Huapi, 40 miles long, is said to be 1000 feet deep.
Lake Buenos Aires, partly in Chile, is 75 miles long. The
lakes number more than 400; at the north are many swampy
lagoons.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Plains</span></h4>

<p>The plains, once under the sea, and now for the most
part less than 500 feet above it with a very gradual rise
from the ocean to the Andes, extend from the Pilcomayo
River, the boundary line with Western Paraguay, on the
north, to the Rio Negro on the south. The northern part
belongs to the Gran Chaco, swampy and partly wooded,
with so slight a southeastward slope that large spaces are
regularly flooded in the rainy season. South of the Bermejo
River which is parallel with the Pilcomayo, the land is
higher, some of it 800 feet above the sea, and the forests
are heavier; but there are still marshy lagoons. Then come
open grassy plains with occasional salt pans. The section
between the Paraná and Uruguay Rivers, called the Argentine
Mesopotamia, in Corrientes at the north is of somewhat
similar character, but has higher land in Entre Rios at the
south. The remainder of the plain is the real Pampa, the
part west of the Paraná River and below that extending to
the ocean, mainly, treeless and grassy. It includes the
Provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fé, Córdoba, San Luis,
Mendoza, and the Territory Pampa Central. In the far
west is a depressed region containing some lakes and
swamps with no outlet, but with too little rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Rivers</span></h4>

<p>The rivers of Argentina are of great importance, being
navigable for immense distances. Chief among them are
those of the System of La Plata, this river being formed by
the union of the Paraná and the Uruguay: a great river
indeed, the outflow of water being 80 per cent more than
that of the Mississippi, and the drainage basin covering
1,500,000 square miles. The Paraguay, Pilcomayo, Bermejo,
Salado del Norte, Iguassú, and many others belong to this
basin. The Iguassú, though not navigable except for a mile
from the Paraná, is world famed for its magnificent waterfall,
surpassing Niagara in height, width, and most of the
year in volume of water; while it is rendered altogether incomparable
by the extraordinary beauty of its setting.</p>

<p>The <b>Plata River</b>, 250 miles long, is much like a gulf,
having a width of over 100 miles at its mouth between
Capes Santa Maria in Uruguay and San Antonio in the
Province of Buenos Aires. The Paraná River with many
tributaries has two principal sources well up in Brazil and
a total length of 2600 miles, about one half in or on the
border of Argentine territory. At first flowing south it
turns west between Argentina and Paraguay, and after receiving
the Paraguay River again flows south in Argentina.
From January to September, nine months, it is open
to trans-Atlantic steamers to Rosario; for 6000 ton vessels,
12 foot draft, to Paraná or Colastiné, the port of Santa Fé;
for smaller steamers up the Alto Paraná nearly to the Falls
of La Guayra, a little above the northeast extremity of
Argentina. Steamers of 7 foot draft go up the Paraguay
to Asunción and smaller steamers to Corumbá in Matto
Grosso, Brazil, 2000 miles from Buenos Aires, and beyond
to Cuyabá. Forty-two miles up stream from Buenos Aires
is Ibicuy, a port where a steam ferry operates, carrying
trains to and from Zarate on the Buenos Aires side.</p>

<p>A few small streams flow into lagoons with no outlet; a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
number in the Buenos Aires Province flow into the Atlantic.
Farther south are rivers of more importance, among these
the Rio Negro and the Colorado, the only ones of this section
easily and regularly navigable.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Climate</span></h4>

<p>The climate of Argentina naturally varies on account of
its wide range of latitude, as well as from increasing altitude
in the mountainous section. The prevailing winds,
the mountain barriers, and the sea also modify the climate
in restricted locations. The conditions of temperature and
rainfall are different from those in the northern hemisphere.
Thus Tierra del Fuego and the south main land are more
habitable than corresponding latitudes in Labrador, partly
by reason of a southern equatorial current; it is an excellent
region for sheep raising. At the same time it is colder than
at similar latitudes of Western Europe, as the prevailing
west winds are chilled by the mountains.</p>

<p>In the Provinces of Buenos Aires, Mesopotamia, and
Santa Fé the average temperature in January is 72°, the
maximum 97°-107°; the annual at the Capital city is 62.6°,
farther south 42°. In Buenos Aires it may rain at any time,
but the greatest precipitation is in the summer and fall. In
summer there is a land breeze by day and a sea breeze at
night. The north winds are hot and unhealthful, ending in
violent storms. Southwest winds, the <i>pamperos</i>, which are
gales, sometimes hurricanes, are invigorating. The central
region has greater extremes of daily heat and of annual
temperature, the widest at Córdoba; Santiago is the warmest
of the Provinces. In the city of Buenos Aires the mercury
in summer may reach 107°; in winter it goes below
freezing only a few times, but there is a peculiar chill in
the atmosphere which causes strong men, who never did so
in New York or Boston, to wear heavy woolen underwear.
The country has 200 meteorological stations.</p>

PROVINCES AND TERRITORIES</span></h3>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Capital</span></h4>

<p><b>Buenos Aires</b>, the metropolis of South America, the
largest city on that continent, and fourth in all America,
has also a wide reputation as the second Latin city in the
world. Its population is well towards 2,000,000, its area
is more than double that of Paris. All its splendors may
not here be rehearsed. The attractions of its 74 beautiful
parks and plazas, its fine avenues, its magnificent Capitol
and other public buildings, its beautiful opera house, almost
the finest in the world, the many artistic and sumptuous
residences, the excellent hotels, with many other admirable
features make it a city delightsome to tourist and resident.
The city is spoken of as a very expensive place to live, but
in ordinary times, some things were cheaper than in New
York while others were much dearer. Rents were high,
the prices of fruit and vegetables, etc. In general, in other
places in Argentina prices were higher for poor accommodations
than in Europe before the War for far better. As
a business centre, Buenos Aires naturally is of prime importance
for the southern part of the continent. From here it
is easy to visit Uruguay, Paraguay, and since the opening
of the Trans-Continental, Chile also; while in every direction
railways radiate to the chief cities of Argentina, even
to those that are accessible by boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Provinces and Territories</span></h4>

<p>We may perhaps get the geography of the Republic most
accurately if we begin near the countries with which we
are familiar at the northwest, and come from the outskirts
to the commercial and political centre of the Republic.</p>

<p><b>Jujuy</b> in the northwest corner naturally has on the north
Bolivia, which comes down a little on the west, where it
is followed by a bit of Chile, then by the Argentine Territory
of Los Andes. The last is also on the south with a
longer stretch of the Province of Salta, which extends along
the entire east border as well. Here in Jujuy we are again
among the mountains, for three ranges come from Bolivia,
passing on through Salta at the south. The <i>puna</i> at the northwest
is nearly 12,000 feet high; on this arid plateau are two
salt lakes. The mountains reach an altitude of 15,000-20,000
feet. There are low valleys too, where there is mixed farming,
not many cattle. Above are the wild vicuñas, guanacos,
and chinchillas, as in Bolivia, and various minerals including
gold, silver, petroleum, etc., not much worked. Sugar
refining and wine making are important.</p>

<p>The capital, Jujuy, is in a rich and picturesque valley as
low as 3675 feet, from which the railway climbs rapidly to
La Quiaca, on the border of Bolivia.</p>

<p><b>Salta</b> extends along the southern border of Bolivia from
Jujuy to Formosa and Gran Chaco on the east; on the south
are Santiago, Tucumán, and Catamarca; on the west Los
Andes with Jujuy. The north and west sections are mountainous
and cold, with high table-lands and fertile valleys;
in the east the terrain comes down to the tropical country,
where in places there are forests though some sections are
hot and dry. Temperate and tropical products are found
here; in the mountains are many varieties of minerals. Cattle
are raised, some being driven over the mountains into
Chile; hence the proposed railway to Antofagasta.</p>

<p>Salta, the capital, with an agreeable climate, is a considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
town, important as a railway centre and with trade
of various kinds.</p>

<p><b>Los Andes</b>, a Territory at the west, is a bleak mountain
region, once belonging to Chile, and a part of the Puna de
Atacama. It is but slightly explored, dry and sandy, with
salt marshes; it appears to be rich in minerals.</p>

<p>San Antonio, the capital, is a place of small importance
not on a railway.</p>

<p><b>Formosa</b> and Gran Chaco, Territories east of Salta, are
precisely opposite to Los Andes in character. Formosa has
Bolivia on the northwest; on the long northeast boundary
the Pilcomayo River separates it from Paraguay, which is
also at the southeast, there separated by the Paraguay
River. On the southwest the Bermejo divides it from the
Chaco, while Salta is west.</p>

<p>The <b>Chaco</b> of similar shape has at the southeast a bit of
the Paraguay River and country, and below a little of Corrientes
across the Paraná. Santa Fé and Santiago del Estero
are on the south, the latter with Salta west. These two
Territories are truly semi-tropical, flat or undulating, sloping
to the southeast, partly covered with dense forests,
not thoroughly explored; partly with open plains, lakes and
marshes, many rivers, much very fertile land suited to
tropical products, some of which are grown, and excellent
pasturage where herds of cattle are bred, horses, sheep, and
goats. The quebracho industry for tannin, and the production
of sugar are important, with some cotton plantations
and castor oil factories.</p>

<p>Formosa, capital of that Territory, is important as a
port, shipping a variety of products down the river, and
as the terminus of a railway to go to Embarcación, opening
up this rich Territory.</p>

<p>Resistencia, capital of the Chaco, on the Paraná River,
is of equal and growing importance. It has railway connection
with Santa Fé.</p>

<p><b>Misiones</b>, at the extreme northeast of Argentina, is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
Territory of some similarity to the two just mentioned, but
with greater attractions and merit. Long and narrow, it
extends up between Paraguay and Brazil, separated from
the former country by the Paraná River on the west, from
the latter by the Iguassú on the north and by the Uruguay
on the southeast, Brazil enclosing it on the north, east, and
south. Misiones joins the rest of Argentina only by a small
strip along the Province Corrientes on the southwest.
Misiones is a subtropical garden largely covered with beautiful
forests where the picking of <i>mate</i> leaves is a leading industry;
there is some timber extraction, and saw mills. It
is an undulating plain with ranges of low mountains and
hills. There are various minerals, and in open spaces some
cattle.</p>

<p>Posadas, the capital, is a pleasant town, important as a
railway and steamboat junction.</p>

<p><b>Catamarca</b>, a Province again at the west, we find bordering
on Chile, south of Los Andes and Salta, with Tucumán
and Santiago east, and Córdoba and La Rioja south.
The Province is largely mountainous, one peak in the eastern
range, Aconquija, being over 15,000 feet. Some short
torrential streams, formerly disappearing in salt marshes,
are now utilized for irrigation. Cereals and other agricultural
products, also cattle are raised. The Province is rich
in minerals, with workings in gold, silver, copper, iron, lead,
and salt.</p>

<p>Catamarca, the capital, on the Catamarca River, is of
some importance as the centre of a rich agricultural district.</p>

<p><b>Tucumán</b>, east of Catamarca, south of Salta, with Santiago
east and south, is the smallest of the Provinces, but
more varied in character than most. It has snow-capped
mountains, and well watered valleys and plains, some quite
tropical; with agriculture, or with dense forests of quebracho,
oak, pine, etc. There is activity in sugar refining
and tanning, with steam saw mills, and with cereals and
fruit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span></p>

<p>Tucumán, the capital, is a large city, especially important,
as the center of the sugar industry, and with many
varied interests.</p>

<p><b>Santiago del Estero</b>, more than seven times the size of
Tucumán, is south of Salta and the Chaco, with Chaco and
Santa Fé east, Córdoba south, and Catamarca and Tucumán
west. Mostly in the lowlands, it is in places covered with
forest; in other parts is a salt, clayey, partial desert which
is now being crossed by railways. Here woodmen cut out
quebracho trees, though in this section it does not rain for
11 months in the year, nor can wells, they say, be dug to
get water unless they are over 3000 feet deep, as water
obtained higher is salt. The summer temperature by day
runs nearly to 120° F., while in winter it falls to 50°, with
cool nights always. Water difficulties are obviously great,
worse than formerly at Iquique. To cross these partly forested
deserts by rail is a 40-hour journey. Between the two
rivers, the Salado and Dulce, both used for irrigation, the
soil is fertile, producing sugar cane, vines, wheat, alfalfa,
for which the soil is favorable, coffee, and tobacco. Some
quarrying of marble and gypsum goes on; but timber is
the main industry.</p>

<p>The capital is a small town of the same name on the
Rio Dulce.</p>

<p><b>La Rioja</b> is a long, irregularly shaped Province south of
Catamarca, with that and Córdoba east, San Luis and San
Juan south, the latter running nearly all the way up on
the west, leaving a small space of Rioja bordering on Chile.
Among high mountains at the west are fertile irrigated valleys
with varied agriculture; there are forests with quebracho,
<i>carob</i>, and acacia; but much of the eastern part is low, sandy,
and barren. Great mineral wealth of many varieties exists, but
silver and copper are chiefly exploited.</p>

<p>La Rioja, the capital, is the centre of a rich fruit growing
district, with some mining.</p>

<p><b>San Juan</b>, with an extended border on Chile, has Rioja<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
north and east, San Luis and Mendoza on the south, on
the west are lofty mountains and well watered valleys; in
the east barren sand hills and marshes. Wine making is
the most important industry; varied minerals give promise
for the future. The Province has been called rather slow,
but it is now said to be waking up; irrigation is beginning
and other improvements will follow.</p>

<p><b>Córdoba</b>, an important Province, much larger, is the
fourth in population and the second in wheat production.
It has Santiago north, Santa Fé east, Buenos Aires and La
Pampa south, and San Luis, La Rioja, and Catamarca west.
Although mostly rather flat, there are mountains in the
northwest of an altitude of 8000-9000 feet among which are
deep broad valleys. The country is chiefly agricultural and
pastoral.</p>

<p>Córdoba, the old capital, founded in 1573, in a charming
location among the hills, preserves some rather mediaeval
characteristics, its university dating from 1613. A wonderful
reservoir is near, the Dique San Roque, called one of the
largest semi-natural reservoirs in the world. A wall of
masonry was built across a gorge among the mountains
forming a lake which holds 825,000,000 cubic feet of water.
Fifteen miles lower is a basin from which lead two primary
canals carrying water for irrigation, which extends over
300,000 acres.</p>

<p><b>Mendoza</b>, the third largest Province and the most southern
of the Andean, with a long border on Chile, is just below
San Juan; has San Luis on the east, and on the south the
Territories of La Pampa Central and Neuquen. The surface
is much diversified, containing the highest peaks of the
Andes including Aconcagua at the west, and eight passes
across the Andes, among them, the famous Uspallata, at
the summit of which is the celebrated statue, the Christ of
the Andes, at a height of 12,796 feet above the sea. More
than 2000 feet below, the Trans-Andine tunnel pierces the
range. The Province has many rivers from which there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
extensive irrigation; for the climate and the soil are dry,
though the latter is fertile when irrigated. It is a great
section for grapes.</p>

<p>Mendoza, the capital, is headquarters for the wine industry.
Grapes are brought thither from the regions
north and south. Raisins and alcohol are also produced.
Excellent livestock, cattle, horses, mules, donkeys, sheep,
goats, and pigs are raised; in the San Rafael section, Durhams
and Herefords, many of which are sent over to Chile.</p>

<p><b>San Luis</b>, east both of Mendoza and San Juan, lies south
of La Rioja and Córdoba, has the latter and La Pampa east,
and La Pampa south. The Province has mountains of the
Córdoba system, some rising to a height of 7000 feet, with
fertile well watered valleys; at the west are swamps, while
the south is flat and arid. There are a number of rivers
and much attention is paid to agriculture, to cattle raising,
and horse breeding. The minerals, of great variety, are
hardly noticed.</p>

<p><b>Santa Fé</b>, the last of the Provinces west of the Paraná
River, extends along its right bank from the Chaco on the
north a distance of nearly 500 miles to the Province of
Buenos Aires on the south, with Corrientes and Entre Rios
on the other side of the river, and Córdoba and Santiago on
the west. This State, second in population to Buenos Aires,
though fifth in area, is a great plain with slight elevations,
having dense forests at the north, at the south the fertile
prairie, and along the great river many islands, covered with
luxuriant vegetation. It is an agricultural, cattle raising
country, with mills and factories also; and with extensive
commerce in cereals, meat, hides, quebracho extract, and
timber, from the many fluvial ports. The chief of these,
Rosario, is the second largest city of the Republic with a
population of 317,000. The Province contains 3000 miles of
railway.</p>

<p><b>Corrientes</b>, east and south of the Paraná River, therefore
south of Paraguay, has Misiones at the northeast, Brazil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
east, across the Uruguay River, Entre Rios south, and
Santa Fé and the Gran Chaco west across the Paraná. The
Province has temperate uplands and warmer lowlands, and
is well watered by rivers and some lakes and marshes.
Corrientes is prominent as a cattle-raising State and has
also large flocks of sheep.</p>

<p>The capital, Corrientes, is an important river-port visited
during most of the year by vessels drawing 12 or 13
feet. Goya, farther south, is famed for its excellent cheese.</p>

<p><b>Entre Rios</b>, south of Corrientes, has Uruguay east beyond
the Uruguay River, Buenos Aires south across the
Paraná, and Santa Fé beyond the same river on the west.
It is in general a fertile, well-watered plain, with a forest
region at the northwest running over into Corrientes, containing
much valuable timber. It is a stock-raising and
an agricultural region, largely devoted to cereals, with
grain of the finest quality. It has also many industrial
establishments.</p>

<p>Paraná, the capital, is a growing centre with some fine
buildings, electric lights, and other facilities. Concordia, on
the Uruguay River, is an important commercial town.</p>

<p><b>Buenos Aires</b>, the last, largest, and most important of the
Provinces, with the greatest population, is the only one with
an ocean front. Buenos Aires has on the north Córdoba
and Santa Fé; northeast, on the other side of the Paraná
and La Plata, Entre Rios and Uruguay; the Atlantic is on
the east and south with a bit of Rio Negro, which with La
Pampa is on the west, with a little also of Córdoba. The land is
flat, but with two ranges of hills; the highest in one range
is 1200, in the other about 3000 feet. Several useful, some
navigable rivers flow towards the ocean. The country is
agricultural and pastoral, especially devoted to cattle and
wheat, but in the numerous towns, industries and manufactories
are developing. Many great railway systems converge
at the Federal Capital. There are good roads near
most of the towns, which is not the case in the other Provinces,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
and good auto roads lead from Buenos Aires to Tigre
and to La Plata.</p>

<p>South of the Provinces, at least below Buenos Aires, is
what was once called Patagonia, now divided into Territories.</p>

<p><b>La Pampa Central</b>, a Territory which extends farther
north, is already from its population entitled to be a Province.
Lying south of Mendoza, San Luis, and Córdoba, it
has Buenos Aires on the east, Rio Negro Territory south,
with the Colorado River as the dividing line; and west,
Neuquen and Mendoza. The Territory is undulating, with
hills, valleys, prairie, and lakes; the soil is generally fertile,
yielding fine crops; wheat, corn, barley, linseed, alfalfa,
vines, fruits. Large herds of cattle roam over the pastures
but are usually sent out for fattening.</p>

<p><b>Neuquen</b>, south of Mendoza, borders on Chile, has Rio
Negro south, and also with La Pampa, east. The north
and east parts are arid, but the west mountain section has
fine fertile valleys and forests, with many rivers and lakes.
A railway now making this section accessible, it will be
more attractive to settlers.</p>

<p><b>Rio Negro</b>, first of the divisions of Argentina to stretch
across the country, has Neuquen and La Pampa on the
north, Buenos Aires and the Atlantic east, Chubut south,
and Chile and Neuquen west. The section between the
Negro and Colorado Rivers is fertile, also patches near other
streams; wherever irrigated, good crops of wheat, corn, oats,
and alfalfa are certain. Fruits and vines do well in the
Negro Valley. Excellent timber is exported in beams and
planks. There are some towns and many agricultural colonies;
trade goes on with Chile in cattle and sheep. Several
rivers are navigable and a railway has been constructed
from the port San Antonio to Lake Nahuel-Huapi.</p>

<p><b>Chubut</b>, south of Rio Negro, also extends across from
the Atlantic to Chile, with Santa Cruz on the south. The
central part has little vegetation but in the west are fertile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
valleys, and good grazing for cattle and sheep. There are
millions of each, and many horses. Cereals and alfalfa are
also raised in the east, with temperate zone fruits and
berries. Near the oil fields of Comodoro Rivadavia is excellent
farming land under cultivation. In this section there
is now great activity on account of the petroleum development;
some railways have been constructed and one is expected
soon to cross the country. There is trade in wool
and hides; gold, copper, and salt exist.</p>

<p><b>Santa Cruz</b>, the largest division next to Buenos Aires,
south of Chubut, has the Atlantic on the east and Chile on
the south and west. The northwest is rather barren and
rocky, with dense forests farther south; but near the coast
and south of the Santa Cruz River are fine pastures supporting
great flocks of sheep. There are many rivers and
lakes, several, like the Buenos Aires, on or near the Chilian
boundary. Wool, frozen mutton, and timber are exported.</p>

<p><b>Tierra del Fuego</b> has the Atlantic Ocean on the north,
east, and south, with the Chilian part of the island on the
west. This triangular part of the island is mountainous,
but has sheltered valleys, good pasturage, and vast forests
with excellent timber, to some extent exploited. There are
large flocks of sheep; the gold and copper deposits are
unworked except for washing the sands. The capital,
Ushuaiá, on the Beagle Channel, is a small penal colony.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI<br><span class="small">ARGENTINA: SEAPORTS AND INTERIOR TRANSPORTATION</span></h3>
</div>


<p>Argentina has a long sea coast, about 1300 miles, with
a number of gulfs and good harbors. The ports of Buenos
Aires and Ensenada, both constructed at great expense, on
the wide La Plata River, may be regarded as seaports. The
best natural harbor is 500 miles by sea south of Buenos
Aires, Bahia Blanca, where the Government has built a port
and naval station, and the harbor is accessible to large ocean
vessels. Farther south are other ports, not greatly frequented
on account of lack of population, but of growing
importance. North of Buenos Aires are river ports, some
of these visited by ocean steamers, others by river boats
only, a few of the latter 1000 miles from the sea. The river
ports above Buenos Aires with facilities for ocean liners
besides Rosario, are Campana, Zarate, Ibicuy, San Nicolas,
and Santa Fé (Colastiné).</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Seaports</span></h4>

<p><b>Buenos Aires</b> has port facilities of the first order, though
insufficient for its great commerce. These are in two divisions:
one, the natural port, is on the Riachuelo, a small
river south of the city, which probably determined the precise
location of its site. The river admits vessels of 18-foot
draft. Capable of an annual traffic of 1,200,000 tons, it is
of great value in national commerce. There are wooden
quays on the north side of the river, now to be rebuilt at a
cost of $400,000, and on the south, concrete docks and quays
constructed by the Southern Railway. On that side are some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
of the noted <i>frigorificos</i> and the famous <i>Mercado de Frutos</i>,
the Central Produce Market, with 180,000 square yards of
floor space.</p>

<p>The main port, receiving the ocean steamers, is on the city
front, extending two miles directly along the Plata River. Constructed
at great expense, and expected to supply the needs of
the city for years, it was completed in 1897; but the growth of
the city soon outran its capacity, so that in 1911 provision was
made for its enlargement, which, however, has not yet been
accomplished. About $35,000,000 have been spent altogether.
The port consists of two basins, <i>darsenas</i>, the north and south,
with four docks between having a depth of 23 feet and a total
area of 164 acres. The length of the quays which may be used
for loading and discharging freight is about ten miles. Along
the docks are 33 warehouses with 30,000,000 tons capacity, and
four sheds. Grain elevators have a total capacity of 300,000
tons of cereals, and granaries of 55,000 tons in sacks. Loading
under cover, the work goes on in bad weather, each elevator
loading 20,000 tons a day. Two dry docks accommodate ships
400 feet long; 874 electric lights, 100 feet apart, serve the harbor
entrance. Sixty-four thousand ships with 22,000,000 tonnage
have entered the harbor in a year, bringing 85 per cent
of the imports and carrying out 50 per cent of the exports of
the country.</p>

<p><b>Ensenada</b>, the port of the made-to-order city of La Plata,
more noteworthy for its university and museum than for its
commercial affairs, has been constructed for the relief of
Buenos Aires, and because, 35 miles lower down, the water
naturally has greater depth. The port has 8000 feet of
quays, warehouses, and other necessary appliances. Two
American packing houses are here located.</p>

<p><b>Mar del Plata</b>, the Newport of South America, 250 miles
by rail south of Buenos Aires, is being developed also as a
commercial port, with quays, warehouses, etc.</p>

<p><b>Bahia Blanca</b>, with a population of 80,000 in the city
and its several ports, is about 700 miles south of Buenos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
Aires. It is of such importance that the Southern Railway
has four different routes for the journey. The city also has
direct connection with Mendoza and with other parts of the
country. Being situated on a large well protected bay of the
ocean, it has a naturally better harbor than Buenos Aires
and may be compared to Liverpool as Buenos Aires to
London. Since 1882 its development has been rapid. With
more than ordinary advantages for business for a city of
its size, including factories, warehouses, and good hotels,
it is a railway centre for lines spreading over the agricultural
and stock-raising districts of southern Buenos Aires,
La Pampa, San Luis, Mendoza, and San Juan, and is the
natural port for these regions. Belgrano, said to belong to
the Compagnie Française, is the real harbor of the city.
Near is the port Ingeniero White with a T-shaped pier,
accommodating 16 ships in 30 feet of water. Electrical elevators
handle 6000 tons of grain in eight hours, while extensive
shops and foundries are a part of the equipment.
Puerto Galvan, 1¹⁄₄ miles west, belongs to the Buenos Aires
and Pacific Railway. Eight ocean steamers of 25-foot draft
and one of 30 may be accommodated here. The basins and
warehouses are of reinforced concrete; elevators with storage
capacity of 18,000 tons and other facilities exist. Besides
the commercial ports, Bahia Blanca has also the naval port
of the Republic, 25 miles southwest of the city on the Southern
Railway. The channel entrance is 25 feet deep at high
tide; there are various quays, also a dry dock, 730 feet long
and 33 deep; a new one of larger size is in preparation.
Other facilities are provided, machinery, workshops, hospital,
electric lighting, etc. There are various fortifications,
strategic railway, telegraph, semaphores, and light-houses.
Hotels for immigrants have been built in the city nearby
for the benefit of those who will go to work in the south.
Sanitary works, costing nearly $2,000,000, are to be installed.</p>

<p><b>Smaller Ports.</b> A number of small ports on the ocean
are served by the Mihanovich Line, formerly also by German<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
lines, while various ocean steamers call at individual
ports. Viedma on the Negro River is the chief port for the
Rio Negro Province, with a fine harbor. San Antonio is on
the same Gulf. On the large Gulf Nuevo are the ports
Pirámides on the north side and Madryn on the south, the
latter a small place, but with over-seas and coasting trade;
a railway 45 miles long goes to Trelew, and to the capital
of Chubut, Rawson. On Camerones Bay several British
companies have large sheep ranches which many years ago
counted 250,000 sheep, 2500 cattle, and 4000 horses.</p>

<p>Comodoro Rivadavia, the famous oil port, is on the Gulf
of St. George, with Visser and other ports in the vicinity.
Deseado is a small port with anchorage for ships six miles
in. San Julian has a harbor with seven fathoms of water.
Puerto Gallegos affords good anchorage ten miles up stream
for ships of 10-20-foot draft. Sheep and cattle are near.
This port, the capital of Santa Cruz, has weekly service to
Punta Arenas. Santa Cruz, on a river of that name, is the
most important town, with a fish cultural establishment.
Ushuaiá receives monthly calls, the voyage from Buenos
Aires occupying 45-50 days according to the number of
calls en route.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Inland Transportation</span></h4>

<p>The rivers of Argentina are of great importance for
inland traffic, with many ports of local service for the export
of grain and other products, and for varied imports; the
chief towns so engaged deserve mention. On the Paraná
River, the principal artery of river travel, excellent steamers
run up to Corrientes, and on the Paraguay as far as Formosa
and Asunción; larger ones go to Rosario only, a night
journey of 240 miles, passing a number of small ports on the
way.</p>

<p><b>Rosario’s</b> importance as a commercial city is due to
General Urquiza, who in 1859 made it a port of entry. Ocean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
steamers drawing 28 feet come to its docks. Situated in
the great cereal section, as a grain port it now surpasses
Buenos Aires. The city located in the Province of Santa
Fé is on a bluff above the Paraná River, along which an expensive
system of docks has been arranged, the new port
extending over two miles with a minimum depth at the
wharves of 25 feet. Separate wharves for ocean and for
coasting steamers are provided, elevators, depots under the
wharves for 30,000 tons of cereals, chutes from warehouses
on the bank, all kinds of needed machinery, depots for general
goods, flour mills, a sugar refinery, and railway connection
with all of the different lines. Port extensions costing
$3,000,000 include a sea wall 1640 feet long, warehouses,
railway lines, and loading apparatus. The production of
$75,000,000 worth of sugar is evidence of prosperity. In
other parts of the city are factories of various kinds. Four
railroads centering here afford direct communication with
other Provinces. Of course the second city of Argentina
has all the conveniences of a place of its size, population
317,000, in the way of fine buildings, hotels, clubs, parks,
theatres, banks, etc.</p>

<p><b>Paraná</b>, capital of Entre Rios, 310 miles from Buenos
Aires on the east bank of the Paraná River, is the next considerable
city; its port, Bajada Grande, a little below, has
some local industries and trade in agricultural and pastoral
products.</p>

<p><b>Santa Fé</b>, capital of that Province, though far smaller
and less commercial than Rosario, was founded before
Buenos Aires by Juan de Garay, seven miles up the small
stream Quiloaza, at a time when a quieter port for their
small vessels seemed more desirable than the great river,
which at Rosario is 20 miles wide. An important railway
centre, its port is Colastiné, opposite to Paraná, and accessible
to ocean steamers.</p>

<p><b>Corrientes</b>, population 30,000, is a rather old fashioned
quiet town in a sheep raising district, with some cattle; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
last port on its left bank before the turn of the river, which
beyond is called the Alto Paraná. Sailing straight north
one is on the Paraguay, up which the larger steamers go
to Asunción. The upper Paraná though broad is much shallower,
accordingly at Corrientes smaller steamers are taken
for Posadas 36 hours distant. The Aripe Rapids, 145 miles
up, also make these necessary. Above Posadas, boats of
still lighter draft are used for the three days’ sail to the
Iguassú, where a landing for the Falls is made at Puerto
Aiguirre, a mile up the river. The boats continue up the
Paraná beyond the northern extremity of Argentina to the
Falls of La Guayra.</p>

<p>Continuing north from Corrientes up the Paraguay, the
mouth of the Bermejo is soon passed and at Asunción the
mouth of the Pilcomayo is reached, the northern boundary
of this part of Argentina, the Territory of Formosa. The
lower large tributary, the Bermejo, separating Formosa
from the Chaco, has recently been made navigable by clearing
the banks and cleaning the river bed, so that with one
transshipment traffic may be carried on for 450 miles. The
journey requires three weeks; but Villa Embarcación, an
important centre of trade on the border of Bolivia was thus
made accessible by water, the town already having rail connection
with Jujuy and Salta, and being but 15 miles from
Orán, another important terminus. Tropical products, as
sugar, cotton, and fruit, are of value, and oil from Bolivia.
The native population of El Chaco is estimated at 25,000
Indians of various tribes; as many more in Formosa. The
forest covered plains are not thoroughly explored, some persons
having lost their lives in the attempt; several are
known to have been murdered in 1900 and 1902. Aside
from these rivers there is little steamboat service in the
interior.</p>

<p><b>The Plata Basin</b>, in size and flow of water second in the
world, and now in economic importance surpassing the
Amazon, includes also the Uruguay River which separates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
the two Republics, serving both for a considerable distance.
The Uruguay, formed by several streams which rise in the
Serra do Mar of Brazil, has a length of 800 miles. It is
navigable for ocean steamers 100 miles to the falls at Concordia
and Salta, above these for smaller craft. Steamers
of the Mihanovich Line from Buenos Aires, after crossing
the Plata enter the rather muddy Uruguay. Passing on the
right the town of Fray Bentos in Uruguay, the first port of
consequence in Argentina is Concepción del Uruguay, a
stock raising centre near which are large estancias, some
devoted to pure blooded, others to crossed stock. Nine of
these estates cover 370,000 acres, with hardly 1200 devoted
to agriculture. Concordia, population 25,000, a little below
the Falls, is an important railway junction with good harbor
accommodations, flour mills, elevators, etc., exporting
wheat, cattle, hides, wool, linseed, <i>mate</i>, and quebracho.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Railways</span></h4>

<p>The railway system of Argentina is developed to a greater
extent than that of any other South American country,
largely due to the opportunity for easy construction presented
by its great plains. The land transportation is complicated,
as there is a real network of railways centering at
Buenos Aires besides smaller centres at Bahia Blanca, Rosario,
and Santa Fé; other cities are at points of junction
of several lines; the most important of these will be mentioned.
The railways have an extension of 22,720 miles,
about 4000 of which are Government owned, 18,000 of
private capital, 670 provincial, and 600 of industrial
railways.</p>

<p>The first railway line in Argentina, six miles long, was
constructed in 1857. The first of importance, 246 miles,
from Rosario to Córdoba, was built by Wm. Wheelwright
in the 60’s. January 1st, 1918, about 22,500 miles of railway
were open to traffic, with other mileage in construction.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
The careful policy pursued in Argentina during this
development has prevented the great evils experienced in
the United States of local land booms and town lot speculations.
Large investments in railways have been made by
European countries, especially by Great Britain, which has
about $1,000,000,000 so placed, and France the next smaller
sum. The value of the privately owned lines is $1,220,000,000,
while that of the Government owned is $150,000,000.
In 1915 the equipment included 7000 locomotives, 6300 passenger
cars, 160,000 freight and service cars. The density
of traffic in Buenos Aires is shown from the fact that 500
passenger trains daily leave the city. Instead of taxes the
railways pay the Government 3 per cent of the net receipts,
which is spent on making roads to the railway stations and
bridges; 60 per cent is allowed for expenses. If above 17
per cent profit is made by a company in three successive
years the Government has a right to lower the rates. The
railways may build branch lines 47 miles long without
special permission, if they do not run within 12¹⁄₂ miles
of another road. Several roads have constructed irrigation
works along their lines, for which they receive Government
5 per cent bonds at par. In 1917 an increase of rates of 22
per cent was allowed by the Government to cover extra
operation costs.</p>

<p><b>The Central Argentina</b> is one of the most important of
the railways, serving the chief cities of north and central
Argentina, Buenos Aires, Rosario, Córdoba, Santa Fé, Tucumán,
etc., and some of the best agricultural lands of the
country. It has the finest railway station and terminal in
South America, the Retiro, and a mileage of 3300. The
main line, extending 720 miles to Tucumán, crosses the Provinces
of Buenos Aires, Santa Fé, Santiago del Estero, and
Tucumán; there are branches in these Provinces and in
Córdoba. Elaborate extensions planned, but suspended on
account of the outbreak of the War, will doubtless be carried
out before long. On account of heavy suburban traffic the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
lines for 17 miles out of Buenos Aires have been electrified
by a third rail. Two thousand passenger trains a week are
handled at the station and 9,000,000 passengers annually.
Through express service is maintained, and connection is
made with the Government Line to the Bolivia frontier at
La Quiaca. In 1913 about 22,000,000 passengers were carried;
9,000,000 tons of freight are handled, 2,000,000 head of
cattle, and other live stock. Aside from the stock the chief
freight is cereals, but sugar, timber, wool, hides, hay, and
lime are also carried.</p>

<p><b>The Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway</b>, equally important,
with the longest mileage, operates about 3800 miles
of road. Ninety per cent of the mileage is in the province
of Buenos Aires, serving the important cities of La Plata,
capital of the province, Mar del Plata, the famous shore
resort, the port, Bahia Blanca, etc. The freight station is
the largest in South America with storage capacity for
230,000 bags of grain and 2000 tons of other freight. A line
goes west from Bahia Blanca through northern Patagonia
to Neuquen and Senilossa, 480 miles, which is handling excellent
traffic especially in cattle. Important irrigation
works have been made by the railway in the Rio Negro and
Neuquen Valleys. The road has a terminus in Plaza Constitución,
Buenos Aires, where 35 trains daily, including
express and de luxe, serve 25-30 million passengers in normal
years. In 1913 besides 6,500,000 head of live stock the
road transported 1,800,000 tons of wheat, 1,000,000 of corn,
227,000 of potatoes, 920,000 of lime and stone, and 2,500,000
general freight.</p>

<p><b>The Buenos Aires and Pacific</b>, an ambitious and adventurous
road, has nearly equal mileage, 3535, some of which
are leased. As its name implies, it operates the main part
of the only transcontinental line of South America. In
addition to the cross country line from Buenos Aires to
Mendoza, and beyond that, the Argentine section of the
Trans-Andine, 111 miles to the Chilian Line midway of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
tunnel, amounting with branches to 1000 miles, the Company
has acquired by lease and construction the Bahia
Blanca and North Western Railway, now extended to Mendoza,
with branches, a length of 900 miles. From Bahia
Blanca a line called the Patagonas Extension has been constructed
167 miles to Carmen de Patagonas at the mouth
of the Negro, giving access to northern Patagonia. Land
is being irrigated with water from the Colorado River in the
effort to attract colonists. It is a property which has been
extended too rapidly to pay dividends at the moment, but of
an assured future. On the North Western Railway wheat,
barley, oats, wine, maize, cattle, sheep, and general merchandise
are the freight; the passenger business is small in comparison.</p>

<p><b>The Buenos Aires Western Railway</b> is fourth in importance,
with 1870 miles of track extending from the Once
Station, on the Buenos Aires subway in the heart of the
city, to sections of La Pampa and San Luis; primarily a
freight road, it now carries many passengers. Electricity is
used for suburban traffic. By tunnel from the Once station,
freight is carried to the port, being by so much ahead of New
York. With the Great Southern, the Western has leased
the Midland Railway from Buenos Aires to Carhue, 320
miles. In 1912-13 the road carried over 7,000,000 head of
live stock, nearly 3,000,000 tons of freight, and 1,000,000
passengers. Wheat, maize, hay, and other agricultural products
are the bulk of the freight.</p>

<p><b>The Córdoba Central</b>, operating 1200 miles, is an amalgamation
of several lines extending from that city, one now
reaching Buenos Aires, one to San Francisco connecting
with Santa Fé and Rosario lines, and another to Tucumán,
there connecting with the Government owned road, the Central
Northern Railway, to the frontier. It is hoped that the
small mileage lacking in Bolivia will soon be completed,
when, as the gauge is the same, it will be possible to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
operate through cars from La Paz to Buenos Aires. The
sugar lands of the north are now traversed by this road,
sugar and cereals being important freight.</p>

<p><b>The Entre Rios Railway</b> is a part of the through rail
route to Asunción, Paraguay, beginning at Ibicuy on the
Paraná River where it is connected with the Buenos Aires
Central by ferry, that road bringing the trains from Buenos
Aires. The road, about 800 miles long, has the standard
gauge, 4 feet 8¹⁄₂ inches.</p>

<p><b>The Argentina North East Railway</b>, in which the preceding
is largely interested, extends through Entre Rios,
Corrientes, and a bit of Misiones to Posadas, forming
another part of the road to Asunción. It has 750 miles of
the same gauge. On account of the war and decrease in
traffic, difficulties were experienced; but in 1917-18 there
was great improvement, the cattle transport breaking all
records, and oranges becoming an important item. By
means of a ferry across the Alto Paraná River from Posadas
to Encarnación there is through service with sleeping and
dining cars from Buenos Aires to Asunción, on account of
which travel has greatly increased as well as shipment of
freight.</p>

<p>The last three railways with several French roads were
in 1912 incorporated under the name of the Argentine Railway,
a Maine corporation, but on account of difficulties from
the War, receivers were afterward appointed. All of the
railways mentioned are British owned, mostly of broad
gauge, 5¹⁄₂ feet. One more is the Central Railway of the
Chubut Company from Port Madryn to Trelaw, about 50
miles, a section settled chiefly by the Welsh. They plan
to carry the road across to the Andean foothills.</p>

<p>While the investments of the British are far larger, the
French also saw here an opportunity and financed several
railways.</p>

<p><b>The Province of Santa Fé</b> Railway is the most important,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
with 1200 miles of line and extensions planned to
Asunción;</p>

<p><b>The Province of Buenos Aires Railway</b> with 800 miles
has a line to Rosario, and one to the coal docks and wharves
of the port of La Plata; and</p>

<p><b>The Rosario to Puerto Belgrano</b>, on Bahia Blanca, 500
miles long, is of broad gauge with the idea of exchanging
freight with the British lines; the other two lines are of one
metre.</p>

<p><b>The Buenos Aires Central</b> is a locally controlled road
operating 250 miles including an important section from
Buenos Aires to Zarate, where ferry connection is made with
lines already spoken of to Asunción.</p>

<p>The War greatly affected conditions in Argentina, but
previously the British-owned roads had made good returns
besides giving work to many British both in Argentina
and at home; as the rails, rolling stock, and coal are
all British. Trade has naturally followed the invested
dollar.</p>

<p><b>The Government Railways</b> have been constructed under
a comprehensive plan chiefly to promote settlement in outlying
districts and to develop fertile territory. Deficits have
resulted, but recently improvements have been shown in
decreasing expenses and increase of gross receipts.</p>

<p><b>The Central Northern</b> is an important road for tourists
and business men, a metre gauge running from Santa Fé
by Tucumán, Jujuy, and Negra Muerta to La Quiaca on the
frontier. It has branches extending to Resistencia, capital
of El Chaco, on the west side of the Paraná; and to Santiago
del Estero, to Salta, and to Embarcación, the last, it is hoped, to
be extended to Yacuiba and ultimately to Santa Cruz of the
Bolivian Oriente. The road to La Quiaca passes a height
of 12,000 feet, the terminus being above 11,000. Salta, the
terminus of another branch, is 6000 feet lower; Embarcación
is lower still, on a navigable stream, the Bermejo. To this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
point the Government is building a road from Formosa on
the Paraguay River to open up that Territory; 186 of the
437 miles are already completed. This rich country now
occupied by savages will then be a source of wealth. A
road running northeast from Diamante, Entre Rios, when
finished will open a rich territory; 106 miles are now in
operation.</p>

<p><b>The Patagonian Railways</b> will make accessible a large
region which is well worth while. Plans call for over 1200
miles of road, 560 of which are now open and showing increase
of earnings. One line from San Antonio on the Gulf
of San Matias to Lake Nahuel Huapi at San Carlos de
Bariloche is just completed, nearly 300 miles. From the
Lake it may be carried over the mountains to connect with
the Chilian Railways at Osorno. Another road is building
from Comodoro Rivadavia on the Gulf of St. George to
Lake Buenos Aires, now complete to Colonia Sarmiento, 122
miles. An important line running more north and south
has been begun and opened 176 miles from Port Deseado in
Santa Cruz to Colonia Las Heras, following up the Deseado
River, later crossing the railway from Comodoro Rivadavia
and going on towards Nahuel Huapi, to the terminus of
these lines. A road is planned from Puerto Gallegos to
Chile, 84 miles towards Punta Arenas with a branch north
to the Puerto Deseado Railway. A narrow gauge is talked
of from San Julian, half way up the coast toward Puerto
Deseado, to the Chilian boundary with one branch to Lake
Argentina, the other to Lake Buenos Aires.</p>

<p><b>Other lines</b> are proposed in the north: one from Salta
to Huaytiquina on the Chilian border, 190 miles, to cost
20,000,000 pesos (if paper, $8,800,000); this Chile is expected
to continue to Antofagasta; one on the other side of the
country, from Candelaria in Misiones, where a port is to be
made on the Alto Paraná, will go northeast to ports on the
Uruguay, connecting the two rivers with 625 miles of light
railway. An industrial railway is expected from Goya or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
Reconquista through the quebracho forest to the western
part of Santiago del Estero.</p>

<p>An aeroplane service for mail and passengers has been
organized to go from Bahia Blanca to Puerto Gallegos, making
ten stops en route.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII<br><span class="small">ARGENTINA: RESOURCES AND INDUSTRIES</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The chief sources of the wealth of Argentina are familiar
to everyone with any knowledge of world affairs: cattle
and agriculture. Stock raising is said to comprise about 50
per cent of the wealth. According to the census of 1914
its value of $8,000,000,000, including land, animals, and
machinery, was just about that. The animals were estimated
at 1¹⁄₂ billion, the land and fixed installations at 6
billions. In stock of various kinds, Argentina is fifth in the
world: with 6 per cent of the total number of cattle, she is
third in sheep with 8 per cent, fourth in horses with 4 per
cent, fifth in goats with 4 per cent, and eighth in pork with
1.2 per cent.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Live Stock</span></h4>

<p><b>Cattle.</b> As to be expected, the live stock industry came
first, requiring less labor. The early development was a
natural one, cattle roaming freely over the plains and multiplying.
From these wild herds, descendants of those
brought over by early colonists, one could take all he wished
up to 10,000-12,000 head, or more with permission from the
Governor. But within the last 40 years much blooded stock
has been imported from Europe, and scientific breeding has
been practised. Twenty-five years ago the stock was estimated
as worth $200,000,000. Of great value to the industry
was the founding of the Argentina Rural Society in
1866; further, the discovery of the preservation of meat at
freezing, and the arrangements for the transport of chilled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
meat. The numerous Stock Shows greatly contributed to
improvements. Beginning at Palermo, Buenos Aires, in
1858, these have for many years been held there annually;
others at various centres as at Rosario, Bahia Blanca, Santa
Fé, Concordia, etc.</p>

<p>On the pampas all over the country cattle and sheep are
raised, though areas are still open in less favorable or accessible
districts. Further increase especially of cattle will
depend to some extent on the improvement of more pasture
lands by the cultivation of alfalfa and other pasturage. The
utility of alfalfa, both as improving the land for wheat and
as food for cattle was early recognized. Its introduction
was a boon to raisers of stock including horses, the alfalfa
growing on brackish lands formerly thought useless, as
well as on wheat lands. On the largest <i>estancias</i> 20,000-50,000
acres are sometimes given to artificial pasturage chiefly alfalfa.
This valuable forage to which 20,000,000 acres are devoted
gives 3-4 crops a year, 6-8 tons to the acre.</p>

<p>A great advance in the quality of the stock naturally followed
the importation between 1901-14 of pedigreed animals,
some at fancy prices: $18,000 for a bull, several horses
at $150,000 or more each; altogether 13,000 cattle, 35,000
sheep, 6000 horses, 3000 pigs, worth $14,000,000; in one year
stock of various kinds worth $1,500,000. Most of these came
from England. Durhams, Shorthorns, are most favored,
but many Herefords are raised, Polled Angus, and other
breeds. As dairy interests are developing, Durhams are
preferred as good milkers as well as good meat. Of the
30,000,000 head of cattle existing before the War (recent
figures are 25,900,000), the largest number was in the Province
of Buenos Aires, about 7,000,000, with Santa Fé and
Córdoba following; millions more are scattered in the Provinces
and Territories from the extreme north almost to the
extreme south. The export of live stock to neighboring
countries has in peace times amounted to $9,000,000. In
some districts drought has been a drawback to stock raising,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
yet it has been difficult to convince the small farmers
of the desirability of artesian wells. Some persons have
thought that as more land is irrigated for farming the
amount of stock would diminish; but Martinez, the leading
authority on such matters, states that 50,000 square leagues
will remain exclusively for breeding. This extent of territory
will support 40,000,000 horned cattle and 200,000,000
sheep, besides the millions which would be raised in the
cultivated districts on the intensive principle. Patagonia
has large regions suited only for stock raising.</p>

<p><b>Sheep</b> cannot be allowed on the high priced land, ruining
the alfalfa, so they are largely relegated to the outlying districts
and to Patagonia; but some high bred sheep are found
on model <i>estancias</i>. In the south the sheep are generally of
Falkland and Romney Marsh origin, crossed with merinos;
they are large and fat, weighing about 150 pounds, some
over 200. Some proprietors produce fleece of 9 pounds
weight. Thick, short wool is preferred, as frost on long
wool prevents the animals moving and so causes great mortality
in winter. In the north Lincolns are favored. The
largest numbers of sheep are in Buenos Aires, Mesopotamia,
San Luis, and Patagonia. During the War wool was in great
demand, and in 1916-17, 350,000 bales were exported, two-thirds
to the United States; in 1917-18, 181,000 tons, one
fourth of which was washed. Diseases are practically unknown,
and the increase sometimes reaches 112 per cent.
A mortality of 20 per cent is due to cold weather. The
number of sheep in 1915 was stated as 80,000,000; recent
figures are 43,300,000. Some of the sheep ranches are very
large, one in Santa Cruz having 100,000 acres fenced in;
others have 50,000 acres or more.</p>

<p><b>Horses</b> number about 10,000,000; Argentine racers are
of the highest quality, as might be expected from the importation
of high class blooded stock. Hogs number 3,000,000,
goats over 4,000,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Packing Houses</span></h4>

<p>The <i>frigorificos</i> are famous; extremely important and
prosperous. British capital was early invested in this industry,
both cattle raising and packing houses. In 1907 American
capital began to turn in this direction. A Swift plant
it is said made a profit of 35 per cent in 1916, one of Wilson
with smaller investment, 300 per cent. Some plants are
for canning also; besides there is meat extract, flour,
tongues, soup, dried beef, etc., and by-products such as
hides, hoofs, grease, etc. In 1919, 15 <i>frigorificos</i> were in
operation, three in Buenos Aires, two in La Plata, three
in Zarate, two in Santa Cruz, and one each in Bahia Blanca,
General Lopez, Santa Fé, Campana, and Tierra del Fuego.
Of these one belongs to Armour and three to Swift; the
former was expecting a daily capacity of 2500 cattle, 5000
sheep, and 3000 hogs; others were to increase production.
During the War the demand for meat as we know increased.
Normally three-fourths of the amount exported is frozen
beef, with mutton next in quantity; but in 1917 for war purposes
canned meat was nearly half in weight of the frozen
beef. The latter was valued at $77,000,000, the former at
$37,000,000, the total meat export at $137,000,000. Due to
millions spent on pedigreed stock, Argentine meat is of high
quality.</p>

<p>In nine months of 1918 the export of stock products,
$365,000,000, was 60 per cent of the total. Of meat export,
frozen beef was more than half and canned beef a quarter.
Wool both dirty and washed was a large item, also skins
and fat. Cattle exported on the hoof, 143,000 head, were
worth $4,200,000. Butter was a large item and cheese considerable.
From 1908 to 1914 the increase had been in
value 116 per cent. In four months of 1919, 1,000,000 head
of cattle were slaughtered, 1,300,000 sheep, and 55,000 hogs;
a larger number than in any corresponding period. The
chief purchasers now are England, France, and Italy; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
exports to other countries are likely to develop so that
increase in stock raising is desirable and the prospect excellent.
The cultivation of alfalfa has increased the capacity
of different lands 3-25 times. It is the feeling on the part
of some Argentines that the packing house industry now
dominated by foreigners should be rather in the hands of
natives; and it is hoped that by eliminating the excessive
profits of the <i>frigorificos</i>, both stock raiser and consumer
may receive a benefit.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Agriculture</span></h4>

<p>Of late years agricultural products in ordinary times
have outstripped stock raising in value, in some years of
good crops being practically double. While regarded as
preëminently an agriculture country, hardly more than one
twelfth of the Argentine area is devoted to the industry
although over one-third is arable land, about 250,000,000
acres. Yet the cultivated land has increased rapidly, being
four times as large in 1916 as in 1872. Thirty-five thousand
square miles are annually offered for sale. The average
area of 62,000,000 acres of cultivated land varies by 2,000,000-3,000,000
from year to year. Of such land one-third is in the
Province of Buenos Aires, one-fourth in Santa Fé, one-fifth
in Córdoba, with Pampa Central, Entre Rios, San Luis,
and other sections following in rapidly diminishing scale.
While the area of wheat and linseed doubled, that of corn
quadrupled, and of oats increased 30-fold; yet wheat is a
long leader. The chief products cultivated are wheat, corn,
flax, oats, barley, alfalfa, sugar cane, and the vine. Others
of importance are tobacco, cotton, peanuts, potatoes, vegetables,
<i>yerba mate</i>, mandioca, fruits, etc. In 1916 over
2,000,000 tons of wheat, and nearly 3,000,000 of corn were
exported with some linseed, oats, and barley. In 1919-20
there was a decrease in acreage sown to wheat and corn,
but a slight increase in linseed. A wheat crop of 5,000,000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
tons is expected for 1921 with 3,200,000 for export; of linseed
1,000,000 tons.</p>

<p><b>Wheat.</b> Over 24,000,000 acres are devoted to its culture.
Although the soil is famed for its fertility the average yield
is not very high, about 11 bushels an acre. One writer
gives 23 bushels as the average in Mendoza with one property
producing 50 bushels. The climate is sufficiently agreeable,
but in some years the rainfall is inadequate, and
occasionally a visitation of locusts seriously affects the
crops, destroying those in some districts; but the regions
are so extensive that all cannot be affected at the same
time.</p>

<p>Extensive farming is beginning to give way to intensive,
especially near the city of Buenos Aires, where land values
are now very high. Argentine authorities state that in general
a great improvement in farming methods is imperative.
Hundreds of large estates are owned by Argentines, while
British investments in cattle and agricultural lands probably
amount to $50,000,000. Only 30 per cent of the estates
are cultivated by their owners. Rentals of lease holders
are usually so short and uncertain that they suffer many
embarrassments and lack ambition to install desirable improvements,
to plant orchards, etc.; a situation which must
be remedied to attain permanent prosperity. The Argentine
leaders realize that instruction is needed to show the importance
of varied cultivation, of rotation in crops, of including
some stock raising, and on other matters. Better credit
arrangements are suggested and other benefits, one of which
has been noted in connection with the countries farther
north, the use of fibre plants to make their own bags, thus
saving a vast outlay for the importation of such needed
articles.</p>

<p><b>Linseed</b> is an important and lucrative production although
the fibre is generally burned. This might be utilized
for paper, and better varieties may be introduced to
advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span></p>

<p><b>Cotton</b>, it is thought, will soon be cultivated on a large
scale. Much progress has been made in the last decade,
and nearly 40,000 acres are now devoted to its culture, most
of them in the Chaco, a few less than 5000 in Corrientes,
Misiones, and Formosa. Regions in Salta, La Rioja, Santiago
del Estero, Jujuy, Tucumán, and Catamarca are also
adapted to its growth, but especially sections near the
Paraná River and its tributaries, altogether nearly 350,000
square miles. Capital and labor are wanting, but as little
machinery is required, less capital is needed for this industry
than for most others. Most of the region is favorable for
river transport. The cotton raised is of good quality, classed
as Strict good, Middling, or Fully good or Middling; fine
and silky, over an inch in length. Several varieties are
cultivated. Land is about $20 an acre. The production in
1920-21 is expected to be 75 per cent more than in 1919-20
and nearly seven times that of four years ago. It is hoped
that within a few years Argentina will provide cotton for
the great manufacturing nations; also that cotton gins will
be supplied, and factories for developing the by-products,
oil, etc., as also for the cotton itself. Cotton gins already
exist in Resistencia and several colonies, where 2000 tons
have been seeded.</p>

<p><b>Sugar</b> is an important production in the north, especially
in the Province of Tucumán, which contains about 85 per
cent of the 250,000 acres devoted to sugar in 1913, 9 per cent
being in Jujuy. The largest amount ever produced was in
1914, about 336,000 tons. In 1913 over 3,000,000 tons of cane
were ground to produce 275,000 tons of sugar, an average
of 8.8 per cent, in Jujuy a trifle more. Later production fell,
in 1917 to 80,000 tons, but rose in 1919 to 250,000, of which
Tucumán produced 178,000 from 2,500,000 tons of cane.
The average yield is under 12 tons per acre. Java cane has
lately been introduced, which will undoubtedly produce
more than double the cane to the acre now obtained from
the native. Much more land is suited to its growth and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
country might be self-sustaining in this line, as it has been
one or two years and also have some to export. Of the
39 sugar mills and refineries in the country, 27 are in Tucumán,
the rest in Santa Fé, Corrientes, Salta, Jujuy, Chaco,
and the Capital. Two are refineries only, these in Rosario
and Buenos Aires; nine refine part of their production, the
rest are sugar mills only. The greatest capacity of the
mills is 417,000 tons, of the refineries 150,400 tons. About
15,000 persons are employed in the industry, at some seasons
over 40,000. Several foreign companies are engaged and
several local, which have paid good dividends. In the entire
industry about $100,000,000 is invested, of which Americans
are said to have 10 per cent. The erection of two sugar
beet factories is considered.</p>

<p><b>Rice</b> culture, like that of cotton, has been developed in
the last decade, as yet in few sections although most of the
country north of Buenos Aires has many marshy tracts
suitable to its growth. Of 25,000 acres planted in 1918-19
Tucumán had 13,000, Misiones one-fourth as much, Salta,
Jujuy, and elsewhere the remainder. In Tucumán the harvest
is most plentiful, about 1250 pounds to the acre. More than
three times the area should be planted to supply the country,
and a superfluity could be exported.</p>

<p><b>Tobacco</b> has long been cultivated though not largely,
40,000 acres in 1895; but there was a gradual decrease
until recently, when production has been augmented almost
to earlier figures. Corrientes, Salta, and Misiones seem
best adapted to its growth. In 1917 over 2,000,000 pounds
were exported worth $500,000. A large and good use for
nicotine is for pastoral and agricultural washes.</p>

<p><b>Vineyards.</b> The climate and soil of Catamarca, Rioja,
San Juan, Mendoza, and Neuquen are excellently adapted
for grape culture, and many varieties flourish of native and
European grapes, but the great rise of freight rates interferes
with sending the fruit to the Buenos Aires market for
consumption. As a pound of grapes in Buenos Aires costs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
15 times as much as the fruit grower receives, the fruit
has become a luxury for the rich. The making of wine is
therefore the chief industry of Mendoza, where 1500 <i>bodegas</i>
or wine cellars of varying style and capacity exist, some,
models of their kind. Some 15 of these have cost about
$500,000 each, but the more common type numbering 1000
have a value of $50,000-$100,000. An excellent quality of light
wine is made for consumption in the country. The Province
of San Juan also contains extensive vineyards and expensive
<i>bodegas</i>. At least 3000 establishments are yearly in operation.
About 1¹⁄₂ billion pounds of grapes are used to obtain
500 million litres of wine (a 68 per cent return) of which
400,000,000 come from Mendoza. A great future for the
industry is expected unless prohibition becomes world wide.</p>

<p><b>Fruit</b> of semi-tropical and temperate zones is increasingly
cultivated, all varieties in the various sections, but
in insufficient quantities. In Chubut apples, pears, plums,
cherries, and ordinary berries of the best quality are raised;
but much fruit is imported from Chile with some from
Europe and the United States.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Forestry</span></h4>

<p>The development of forestry is slight and the importation
of timber for building and furniture is large; yet the
country contains all that is needed, and by planting under
favorable conditions might have much more.</p>

<p><b>Quebracho.</b> In the subtropical country, which is the
entire north aside from the mountains, the most valuable
wood is the quebracho, of two varieties, red and white.
The tree takes 90-100 years to reach maturity, with a height
of 80 feet and a diameter of about 2¹⁄₂ feet. Logs are
exported for the extraction of tannin, though tannin is
extracted locally in increasing quantities, and shipped. The
wood is much employed by the railways for sleepers as it
does not decay from standing in water. Lately, owing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
shortage of coal much has been used in locomotives for
fuel, and some for manufactories. Formerly Great Britain
was the principal purchaser, but of late the United States
has taken the most. In 1915 over $15,000,000 worth of
extract was exported and $2,500,000 of logs. Quebracho,
break-axe, is of course extremely hard, but there are other
hard woods like cedar, and many varieties of valuable
timber.</p>

<p><b>Yerba mate</b> is cultivated in many places, especially in
Misiones; the wild growing trees of the forest furnish a
still greater supply of the leaves. From these a drink is
made which outside of the large cities is in this part of
the continent far more popular than tea or coffee.</p>

<p>The northern forests contain several varieties of rubber
trees, but none are exploited. Along the Andes are forests,
the principal ones from Lake Nahuel Huapi south. Those
in this region are believed to be worth $10,000,000,000. The
variety of native woods both hard and soft is large; and
trees of other countries have been introduced. Thousands
of eucalyptus trees have been planted on many <i>estancias</i>,
serving a useful purpose in many ways, beside being an
ornament on the level plain.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Mining</span></h4>

<p>In the description of the Provinces, mention has been
made of the minerals existing in various localities, but up
to the present time the working of these has been slight.
Tungsten, gold, copper, wolfram, borax, and petroleum have
received the most attention, but few are those who have
realized any considerable profits. Within ten years the
exports have amounted to hardly more than $3,000,000.</p>

<p><b>Gold</b> is mined in small quantities in various places; in
southern Patagonia it is gathered from the coast sands
after a heavy sea storm. In Neuquen and Catamarca are
workings of fair size. The copper deposits of the Andes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
are difficult of access but may be developed later. Silver
was mined formerly, but the ore was of moderate grade
and the work was discontinued. A reverberatory smelter
has recently been installed for the mines in Rioja.</p>

<p><b>Coal</b> deposits exist in Mendoza, San Juan, Neuquen,
Chubut, and Tierra del Fuego. The coal is not very good
but will help in view of the shortage and high prices.
Work is being done in San Juan and Mendoza. It is proposed
to open mines among large deposits in Chubut, though
the coal will have to be carried 180 miles to a railway.</p>

<p>The <b>tungsten</b> industry is active; 900 tons have been
mined in one year, about one-seventh of the world production.
Exploitation of marble, wolfram, and mica in Córdoba
and San Luis is showing good results.</p>

<p><b>Manganese</b> is exported in increasing quantity chiefly
from the desert section of Santiago del Estero.</p>

<p>Large <b>saline</b> deposits exist, some in basins with no outlet,
in the central Provinces, some of volcanic type on the
Puna of Atacama, others near the ocean not far from Bahia
Blanca. Some of them have been exploited. Importation
of salt has diminished and home production is expected
shortly to suffice for local needs.</p>

<p><b>Petroleum</b> is now exciting the greatest interest. Oil
is known to exist in four regions with others reported, but
only one has been thoroughly tested, that at Comodoro
Rivadavia. Borings carried on here by the Government
struck oil at a depth of about 1800 feet in 1907. In 1910,
12,000 acres were reserved for Government exploitation
which has since been carried on. The place is near the
coast about 850 miles south of Buenos Aires. Development
has been rather slow, but in 1916, 25 wells had been sunk
and 21 were in active production of about 14 tons each per
day. There were four steel tanks and other storage space,
in all about 26,000 cubic meters, one such of this oil equalling
.93 metric ton. In 1917, 36 wells were in production and 19
being bored. In 1918 about 1,250,000 barrels were produced.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
Tank steamers are provided, and storage tanks in Buenos
Aires. An oil tank is begun in Rosario. Others are to be
constructed in Buenos Aires, Bahia Blanca, Puerto Militar,
Santa Fé, and Mar del Plata. The oil is heavy with an
asphalt base; distilled, it yields 1.5-3.5 per cent of naphtha
and gasoline, 15-19 per cent of illuminating oils, and 77-85
per cent of lubricating oils, fuel, and coke. Heavier than
the better grades of United States oil, it has been used
almost entirely as fuel, though it is said that it will distil
readily. This will undoubtedly be its chief usefulness, to
serve instead of coal. It is employed by a number of factories.
A new Government well, 1921, was producing 34,000
barrels a day, and prospects are of the best. Millions have
been appropriated for tank steamers, machinery, and for
intensive development of the oil fields. The price rose from
about $10 a ton in 1916 to $40 in December, 1917. Government
control will probably continue, especially because the
oil is likely to be used by the navy.</p>

<p>A few private companies are operating outside the
restricted area, using 12-inch tubes, while the Government
has used smaller. One Company with a capital of $2,000,000
has with other equipment 4.3 miles of railway connecting
with the Government railway to the port, also two miles
of pipe line. Many of the <i>frigorificos</i> use oil, mostly Mexican.
The West India Oil Company imports from the United
States or Mexico, mainly for refining.</p>

<p>The other fields are the Salta-Jujuy, the Cacheuta, a few
miles south of Mendoza, and the Mendoza-Neuquen field,
700 miles southwest of Buenos Aires. In these fields the
oil has a paraffine base, a sample from Jujuy showing 5 per
cent of light oil, 30 per cent of kerosene, and 52 of lubricating
oil; a grade equal to that of Pennsylvania or Ohio.
One such field in Neuquen justifying immediate development
is favorably located 824 miles from Buenos Aires
near the Ferrocarril del Sud, which will provide special cars
and tariff, so that speedy results are hoped for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Industries including Manufactures</span></h4>

<p>While Argentina is primarily an agricultural and pastoral
country and is likely so to continue, a fair amount of
capital is invested in manufacturing and in other commercial
projects, some of the capital European. The largest
sum is invested in Light and Power Companies; for all
cities of any size have electric lighting and many, electric
traction. About $128,000,000 have been thus invested; in
packing houses 40 millions, flour mills 7; in sugar refineries
50, wine making 78, foundries and metal works 25, dairies,
etc., 43, tannin extract, etc., 33, lithographing and printing
12, breweries 14, construction companies 11, these all millions.
Other companies with investments of 5-10 millions
are shoes, saw mills, jute and cotton sacks, carpentry,
painting and horse-shoeing together; liquors, tanneries,
cotton and woolen mills, furniture, trunks and tapestries,
leather goods, brick kilns, clothing, wagons and carriages,
ice and aërated waters, ore smelting, grain elevators; many
more with investment of 1-5 millions, besides a total of 47
million in still smaller companies.</p>

<p>Of other lines, in 1916 there were 71 telephone companies,
capital $15,000,000; 143 banks, capital about $500,000,000,
employing 10,000 persons; 85 insurance companies.
The companies of all kinds generally are on a sound and
paying basis, in spite of high cost of fuel and power. The
two leading department stores in Buenos Aires, equal to
our best in character, are both British owned; there are
many other shops of every kind of the highest class.</p>

<p>The tramways and subway of Buenos Aires are noteworthy.
The tramway system has been called the best in
the world. There are 500 miles of lines, carrying about
400,000,000 passengers yearly. Packing like cattle is not
allowed, the number of persons per car being strictly
limited. The subway 8.7 miles long carries 2,500,000 with
a splendid system and fine service including one for freight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
Extensions were postponed on account of the War. The
water supply, taken from the river, and the drainage system
are of the highest character. A revenue of $7,000,000 is
received by the Government.</p>

<p><b>Dairy Products.</b> The dairy industry is of quite recent
development; butter formerly imported in quantity is now
becoming an article of export. From 1914 to 1918 the production
of cheese increased 277 per cent, of butter 162 per
cent. Three thousand existing creameries, most of which
are in the Provinces near the Capital, in 1918 made 50,000,000
pounds of butter, 40 million of cheese, and 15 of casein.
More than half the butter and some cheese was exported.</p>

<p>The growth of other industries has caused a great falling
off in many imports; of preserves 62 per cent, of ham
96, preserved vegetables 87, beer 98, cider 55, common wine
85. Other things as chocolate, macaroni, fruit crackers,
shoes, and cloth have decreased 50 per cent. Of fideos
enough is produced for home use, and to export in 1918
over 2,000,000 pounds.</p>

<p><b>Furniture.</b> The construction of furniture has attained
large proportions, a great part of what is sold in the country
being made in Buenos Aires though often bearing foreign
names. Wood is imported, even $25,000,000 worth in one
year, while the finest woods grow in the country. Of 305
saw mills, 134, the most important, are in the City and
Province of Buenos Aires far from the forests. The small
mills near the woods merely chop off the branches for
transport or prepare firewood. Cut wood from Buenos
Aires is returned to Misiones and Corrientes for construction,
a terrible waste. A change has begun; the mills near
the forests are being enlarged and equipped with machinery,
so an evolution of the industry is under way.</p>

<p><b>Paper.</b> Eight paper factories with capital of $8,000,000
employing 1500 persons produce 40,000,000 pounds of paper,
28,000,000 for packing, the rest for newspapers, books, and
other things. A great quantity is still imported, formerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
from Germany, lately much from the United States. The
paper is made of rags, shreds of paper, and pasteboard, the
consumption of pulp being small, hardly 200,000 pounds.
One factory at Barranqueras, on the Paraná River in the
Chaco, employs a kind of bog grass to make three tons
of straw board a day.</p>

<p><b>Flour.</b> The flour mills are of great importance, supplying
in 1919, 850,000 tons of flour for home use and some for
export. In 1918, 176,445 tons were exported. With fewer
mills than formerly, the 400 existing are more productive.
The 79 in Buenos Aires, 47 in Santa Fé, 44 in Entre Rios,
and 26 in Córdoba produce 95 per cent of the total. Sixty-one
per cent of the mills are Argentine owned. One hundred
and fifty two are steam mills, 156 hydraulic. They have
25,000-30,000 horse power and employ 10,000 persons. About
$34,000,000 are invested in the industry while the production
is $100,000,000. However the farmers have trouble,
as the fee for hauling grain has increased 60 per cent, and
cartage 25 miles to a station is as much as the freight from
Buenos Aires to New York. A flour mill in Mendoza and
in other western cities of the wheat belt would undoubtedly
pay handsomely, saving expensive transport. A new flour
mill at La Plata to cost $500,000 is to turn out a quantity
sufficient to fill 1000 bags a day.</p>

<p><b>Beer</b> is made in 25 factories for the consumption of the
entire country, a quantity of 80,000,000 litres worth $12,000,000.
To produce the 7000 horse power needed, thousands
of tons of coal, wood, and petroleum are consumed.</p>

<p><b>Other Manufactures.</b> Factories making shoes, said to
be of the best quality, underwear, umbrellas, acids, perfume,
and many other articles are found. Vegetable oils are extracted
from peanuts, linseed, rape, cotton seed, and other
articles, in establishments in Buenos Aires and Santa Fé.</p>

<p>Altogether there are about 50,000 industrial establishments
with a capital of $800,000,000 using 678,000 horse
power, employing 500,000 persons, consuming nearly $500,000,000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
worth of material, and producing nearly $1,000,000,000
worth of goods. About half of these are extractive
or manufacturing. One-third belong to the Argentines who
supply 18.67 per cent of the capital.</p>

<p><b>Developing Industries.</b> The Government is interested
in the establishment of other factories and construction work;
a cement factory in Buenos Aires to make 300,000 tons per
annum is considered, the Government now using 700,000 tons
a year. Ship building is encouraged; a steel ship of 1250 tons
was launched at Riachuelo; yards are to be constructed at
the port of Carmen de Patagones on the Rio Negro by an
Argentine company with capital of 50,000,000 pesos. Some
armored cement oil-tanks of 6000 tons capacity are to be made
for Comodoro Rivadavia, and a depot for petroleum and
naphtha at the port of Mar del Plata. Also for the former,
port works, a breakwater, a mole for loading, and houses for
workmen at a cost of 17,000,000 pesos. Sanitary works for
16 towns at a cost of 9,800,000 pesos are provided for, 22,000,000
pesos are to be spent in three years for machinery and
tank steamers to develop the Government oil wells, the exploitation
of which will cost 45,000,000 pesos; present production
is yet insufficient.</p>

<p>A Spanish Argentine Corporation with a capital of $10,000,000
is to build two large <i>frigorificos</i> at Buenos Aires and
Santa Fé, with steamers to transport beef to Spain. Another
<i>frigorifico</i> is designed for Puerto Deseado in the south to
coöperate with local ranchmen.</p>

<p>The lack of combustibles has for many years been a
great and embarrassing problem, an early solution of which
is now hoped for. Importation of coal from England and
of petroleum from the United States has been carried on
at great cost. In five years, 1912-16, $190,000,000 was spent
for such articles, while as they say petroleum ran into the
sea and wood rotted at the railway stations. In 1919 coal
was $26 a ton. The forests of the north have an inexhaustible
supply of wood; the charcoal industry is quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
well developed in the Chaco, north Santa Fé, Tucumán,
and Santiago. Many woods are appropriate, but high
freights have impeded their use. A large deposit of coal is
recently reported in Tucumán. A new railway to the firewood
region of Santiago del Estero will save a 100 mile
haul. A splendid source of electric power are the Iguassú
Falls with 275 cascades, the greatest with a height of 213
feet. Investigation shows that 500,000 horse power is easily
available, one half each for Brazil and Argentina. Ten
thousand horse power would be sent 800 miles to Buenos
Aires, the rest used in Misiones, Corrientes, and Entre Rios.
From the Salto Grande Falls on the Uruguay 50,000 horse
power might be available for Argentina and Uruguay each.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Investments</span></h4>

<p>The opportunity for investments for persons with capital
is evidently large. A great deal of money is necessary for
stock raising, though less in the far south. Agriculture,
especially the raising of cotton, rice, or tobacco might be
attractive; the sugar industry may be extended. Factories
of various kind may be established by experts. Persons
speaking Spanish fluently, capable of acting as foremen or
superintendents of establishments of various kinds, might
find employment. The minerals with the exception of
petroleum are less accessible than in some other countries.
An American department store in Buenos Aires is desirable,
and one might succeed in Rosario.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII<br><span class="small">PARAGUAY: AREA, HISTORY, GOVERNMENT,
POPULATION, ETC.</span></h3>
</div>


<p>Paraguay has been called the most romantic of all the
South American countries, from the point of view of nature
and history both. It is a land of “dolce far niente” so far
as agreeableness is concerned, a land where nature is lavish
and necessities are few; on the other hand a region where
the climate is not enervating, where energetic action and
enterprise are not altogether lacking, and where these find
ample reward. One of the two inland countries of the continent,
having always been such, she has no grievance on
this account. In fact, being in the heart of South America
and almost surrounded by rivers, Paraguay has in many
ways a most favorable location for inland commerce, which
will surely bring her prosperity.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Area, Population, Boundary</span></h4>

<p><b>Area.</b> Paraguay, generally called eighth in size of the
South American Republics, has an area of about 165,000
square miles, more or less, according to the determination
of the boundary dispute with Bolivia. One hundred and
ninety-six thousand miles is claimed by the Paraguay Government.
The more settled part of the country east of the
Paraguay River covers about 65,000 square miles; the section
west, which on most maps is given to Paraguay, though
claimed by Bolivia, is more uncertain in area, but may have
100,000 or more square miles. With the other neighboring
countries the boundaries have been definitely determined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span></p>

<p><b>Population.</b> As in several other countries, the population
of Paraguay can be estimated only, since no exact
census has ever been taken. Approximate figures given
by different writers are 800,000-1,100,000.</p>

<p><b>Boundary.</b> Paraguay has Brazil on the north and east;
Argentina, too, is east, is exclusively on the south, and
partly on the west; while Bolivia is west and north of the
Chaco, the dividing line being uncertain.</p>

<p>The greater part of the way rivers form the boundary
line. The Paraná separates Paraguay proper from Argentina
on the south, and on the east as far as the Iguassú
River; north of the latter river Brazil is on the opposite
shore of the Paraná to beyond the Sete Quedas, or Falls of
La Guayra (higher up the Paraná is wholly in Brazil);
the boundary line then goes west and north along the
watershed to the source of a branch of the Rio Apá, which
with that river it follows west down to the Paraguay.
Above the point of junction the Paraguay River has Brazil
on the east bank and for some distance the Paraguayan
Chaco on the west. Below the Apá, the Paraguay divides
the country into sections, as far as the Pilcomayo River,
on the southwest of which is Argentina. Below, along the
Paraguay River to the Alto Paraná, Argentina is on the
west. The Chaco section may be said at present to be in the
practical possession of Paraguay, so far as it is occupied
by any one except savages.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">History</span></h4>

<p>It seems extraordinary that here in the centre of the
South American continent, 1000 miles from the sea, is one
of the oldest cities, the capital of the Republic, Asunción,
founded a full century earlier than Providence (1636), and
85 years before the landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth.
Juan de Ayolas, sent by Pedro de Mendoza after the first
settlement at Buenos Aires (not long after destroyed), in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
1536 established here a colony; then sailing up the river to
a place he called Candelaria, with a few followers he boldly
struck off through the forest towards Peru. Irala, left
behind to await his return, proved faithful; but after long
waiting in vain, being obliged twice to go to Asunción for
provisions, he learned at last that Ayolas, after a successful
journey to Alto Peru, had arrived in his absence and
had then been slaughtered by savages: a tragic sequel of
heroism, fitly to be compared to that of Captain Scott, his
achievement of the South Pole, followed by the disastrous
return journey.</p>

<p>Irala, later becoming Governor, was one of the few <i>Conquistadores</i>,
after many vicissitudes, to die peacefully in 1557.
Until 1776, Asunción was the chief Spanish city of the eastern
slope of South America. Buenos Aires then became the seat
of a Viceroy, in that year appointed.</p>

<p>In 1810, after expelling the Viceroy, the Argentines sent
up a small army, expecting Paraguay also to revolt, but she
declined. However, in 1811 the Paraguayans expelled the
Spanish Governor; in 1814 a despotism under Dr. J. G. R.
Francia came into being. At his death in 1840, his nephew,
Carlos Antonio Lopez, succeeded to power, followed in 1862
by his son, Francisco Lopez. This young man, who had visited
Europe, soon organized a well drilled army with the idea of
becoming a second Napoleon, in South America. His opportunity
came when Uruguay appealed for his assistance against
the Portuguese of Brazil. Crossing Argentine territory to
invade Brazil, in spite of the refusal of Argentina to give
permission, Lopez became involved in war with both of the
larger countries and later with Uruguay. Although so small,
Paraguay might have held her own against one of the larger
Republics, but after making a desperate struggle for nearly
six years, during which most of the male citizens were killed,
boys of 12-15 forced to fight, women compelled to work in the
fields and to act as supply bearers, with cruel persecution from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
the Dictator, the army was utterly wiped out, and Lopez killed
in 1870. Three-fourths of the population had perished.</p>

<p>Not yet has the country recovered its previous condition
and numbers, several revolutions having interrupted its growth;
the last in 1911-12. Curiously, the people pride themselves on
being one of the most homogeneous of the South American
Republics and the best fighters.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Government</span></h4>

<p>The Government organized in 1870 is of the usual form
with three branches. The President, elected for four years,
is not again eligible for eight years. There are two Houses of
Congress, a Senate of 13 members and a Chamber of 26
Deputies. A Permanent Committee of Congress sits during
the interval between sessions, both to provide for emergencies
and to prevent usurpation by the Executive. The Judiciary
has a Supreme Court, two Superior Courts of Appeal, Civil
and Criminal Courts with Lower Courts and Justices.</p>

<p>The section west of the River is under military command;
the part east has 23 electoral districts with subdivisions. As
in Argentina, all persons born in the Republic are deemed
citizens.</p>

<p>There are said to be 20 Districts, some of which along the
Paraguay from the north are Concepción, San Pedro, Villeta,
Pilar; farther east Caraguatay, Yhú, Paraguarí, Guaira,
Guindí, Caazapá, San Ignacio, and Encarnación. All have
capitals of the same name except Guaira, the capital of which
is Villa Rica. Data as to area and population of these is
lacking.</p>

<p>An unusual official is a Defender General of the Poor,
of Minors, and of Absentees.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Population</span></h4>

<p>The Paraguayans claim that their people are nearly pure
Spanish, with slight admixture of Guaraní, this being the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
most numerous, intelligent, and peaceful of the Indian tribes
of that region. Preserving the spirit of the invaders, they
are an unusually hardy race for one on the edge of the tropics.
While Spanish blood and culture largely predominate in the
capital, the population of the rural districts is more primitive
in character.</p>

<p>The number of the people is uncertain, but may reach
1,000,000, including 50,000, some say 100,000 wild Indians
belonging to several tribes, chiefly in the Chaco. In the eastern
section of Paraguay proper there are probably not over 25,000
persons, most of the population being east and south of the
mountainous section and especially near the Paraguay River.
They say that there are no idle or poor in the country, although
many may be seen barefoot in Asunción; as the simple life is
popular, little clothing is needed, and food is abundant. (Of
late the standard of living has been rising.) For this reason
the country people generally lack energy and ambition. Most
of the inhabitants are engaged in agriculture, some also in
pastoral pursuits. The native women are called superior to
the men. Burdens thrown upon them during their great war
made them resourceful and independent. The men as a rule
are peaceful unless they have been drinking <i>caña</i>, which is
now forbidden by some large employers of labor. In the section
east of the mountains are uncivilized Indians of the
principal tribes, one timid and retiring. Some of the Cainguaes
at times work in the <i>yerbales</i>. The Indians in the Chaco are
of a number of different tribes of a low order of civilization,
who are mostly nomads, and live by the chase and fishing.
A few work at <i>estancias</i> spasmodically, never for long.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Education</span></h4>

<p>Education is backward, though the percentage of illiteracy,
if about 60 as is said, may be less than in some of the other
Republics. With the scattered population, chiefly in the
country and in small towns, to provide educational facilities
for all is impossible. There is a University in Asunción with
five Faculties; secondary schools in Asunción, Pilar, and Villa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
Rica; and six Normal Schools. A School of Commerce with
night and day classes does good work in the capital, where
the <i>Instituto Paraguayo</i> is of important cultural value, recently
receiving a library of 2000 volumes in English from the
Carnegie Peace Foundation. The <i>Banco Agricola</i> has done
much for the diffusion of general education as well as more
specifically in agriculture. As in other countries, some young
men go abroad to study, either on Government scholarships
or with private means.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Press, Religion, etc.</span></h4>

<p><b>Press.</b> The capital is well supplied with newspapers
and periodicals; little journalism exists elsewhere.</p>

<p><b>Religion.</b> The religion is Roman Catholic, but there is
complete toleration for other creeds. An important work
has been carried on in the Chaco by W. Barbrooke Grubb
and others of the English Church. Schools have been established,
with an industrial and intellectual as well as a
religious centre. Civil marriage alone is legal.</p>

<p>Telegraphic communication with the outside world is
carried on by way of Posadas and Corrientes, but frequent
interruptions in service have made it unsatisfactory. There
are over 2000 miles of wire in the interior. Wireless is used
by the Government to communicate with the garrison
towns. There are stations at the Capital, Concepción, and
Encarnación. In 1919 there was no Telephone service in
Asunción, as the station had been destroyed by fire; but
such service existed in Concepción, Villa Rica, and Paraguarí.</p>

<p><b>Money.</b> The Money in use is paper, the standard, a gold
peso equal to the Argentine, 96.5 cents. The paper peso
varies in value, in 1920 being worth five cents. The value
of exports and imports is declared in gold, an Exchange
Bureau supplying local money at the actual rate. Thus
fluctuations affecting commerce have ceased and business
has improved.</p>

<p><b>The Metric System</b> of weights and measures is usual.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX<br><span class="small">PARAGUAY: PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</span></h3>
</div>


<p><b>Highlands.</b> The physical features of the country are
simple, the Paraguay River dividing it into sections: the
Gran Chaco, to some extent unexplored in detail, and the
Oriental. The latter, Paraguay proper, is traversed from
north to south by a broad irregular belt of highlands, nowhere
much above 2200 feet. The angle of the ridges is
sharper on the west, the country undulating in gradual
slopes from the foot. On the east, spurs run out enclosing
deep valleys, and the country has more of an upland character.
The streams flowing west to the Paraguay are smoother
and to some extent navigable, while those flowing east and
southeast to the Alto Paraná are interrupted by rapids and
falls.</p>

<p><b>Plains.</b> In the southwest section between the Paraguay
and the Paraná there is considerable marshy country, part
draining into the Ypoa lagoon; other marshy lowlands
occur along the Paraguay River. All these could be drained
at moderate expense, thus providing much rich and accessible
land. The western section, containing most of the
inhabitants, has an average altitude of about 600 feet. In
the more settled parts of the west and south are extensive
grassy and open lands, and hills covered with forests, while
clumps of trees are frequent in the lowlands. The soil of
the western part is rather dry and sandy except near the
rivers and marshes. It is extremely rich, of a reddish color
due to impregnated iron. Above is a thick layer of humus,
formed by centuries of decaying vegetation. In places the
soil is clayey, or has a substratum of clay beneath. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
is true of most of the forest region, and of the swampy
section. Of Paraguay proper the western part is 25 per
cent forest, the middle 66, the eastern 95 per cent.</p>

<p>The Gran Chaco, though called a plain, and flat near the
rivers, is somewhat hilly. Rarely, a freshet on the Paraguay
or the Pilcomayo transforms the neighboring country
into great lakes, these sometimes extending 20 or 30 miles
back from the river. Along the river banks is usually a
narrow strip of forest, from which the soil and trees
occasionally crumble into the stream, especially along the
Pilcomayo, thus impeding navigation on that river. Farther
back are open plains dotted with groups of palms, and
some stretches of forest. The average altitude is 426 feet.
Little is known of the country north of 22°.</p>

<p><b>Rivers.</b> The country is greatly favored with rivers.
The Paraguay, 1800 miles long, rises in Matto Grosso,
Brazil, near the source of the Tapajós, a branch of the
Amazon. From the east the Paraguay receives several
important streams. Below the Apá, the northern boundary,
two tributaries, the Aquidabán and the Ipané, are nearly
200 miles long. More important is the navigable Jejui (all
these north of Asunción); still more the Tebicuary, entering
the Paraguay far south of Asunción by two mouths,
one over one-half, the other over one-third of a mile in width.
The Alto Paraná is different, a more rocky and a shallower
stream than the Paraguay. From that country it has many
affluents, the Monday over 100 miles long with great cataracts
in the lower part but navigable above. The Paraná
River, 2000 miles long to the mouth of the Uruguay, rises
in Goyaz, 665 miles above the Sete Quedas. It is 100 miles
more to the Iguassú, then 492 to Corrientes, and 676 beyond
to the beginning of the La Plata.</p>

<p>The rivers of the Chaco are more sluggish. Even the
Pilcomayo is untraced in its middle course where vast
swamps impede passage by land or water. The river is
navigable in its lower reaches for a considerable distance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
and the upper part is well known. The River Confuso is
a smaller stream of similar character. Paraguay has few
lakes save those swampy in character, but one, Lake
Ipacaraí, east of Asunción, is a popular beauty spot, with
pleasure and health resorts. Lake Ypoa is larger and both
are navigable by boats of slight draft.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Climate</span></h4>

<p>The climate of the country is called ideal, that of course
depending on one’s taste. In general it is subtropical with
two seasons, the summer temperature averaging 81°, the
winter 71° or less. The rainfall is fairly distributed, the
most in the hot months, December to February. Sudden
changes of weather occur; from hot, humid north winds,
or cooling south winds from the Argentine plains. In places
the winter temperature may fall to 33°-42°, even with frost,
but not near the Paraná River where there are fogs. In
summer the maximum temperature at Asunción occasionally
reaches 100° or more, and there are 60 inches of rain;
more farther east, but less in the Chaco.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL<br><span class="small">PARAGUAY: THE CAPITAL AND OTHER CITIES</span></h3>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Capital</span></h4>

<p><b>Asunción</b>, the population of which is variously given as
80, 90, 100, 120, and 125 thousand, is a quiet town on the
Paraguay at a point where the bank rises to a considerable
height, affording good drainage, and from the palace a pleasing
view. An English writer calls the city the nicest, cleanest
town above Buenos Aires. Although 1000 miles from the
ocean, it has an altitude of but 203 feet above sea level.
The classical building of the Custom House stands by the
river side. The palace above, built by the Dictator,
Francisco Lopez, as a residence, is used for the offices of
the President and his Cabinet. Other important buildings
are a House of Congress, a Cathedral, a Museum of Fine
Arts containing a Murillo, and a National Library with
many priceless documents.</p>

<p>The several hotels are fairly comfortable if not exactly
modern in character. There are electric lights and electric
car service. The streets at last accounts were poorly paved
with rough cobble stones, but some automobiles are in use.
The city is steadily advancing in commercial importance,
80 per cent of the imports and 40 of the exports passing
through its Custom House.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Other Cities</span></h4>

<p>From the meagre information available, to describe
individually the various States or Districts of Paraguay is
impossible, as also unimportant, the sparse settlements having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
little marked variation. Mention will be made instead
of the principal towns, few of which have a population of
15,000.</p>

<p><b>Villa Rica</b>, population perhaps 30,000, 40 hours from
Buenos Aires and 93 miles from Asunción, is the second
city of Paraguay. Situated in a rich agricultural district,
it is destined to a sound if not rapid development. It will
become important later as a railway junction; for the railway
designed to cross the Paraná River into Brazil just
above the entrance of the Iguassú, passing the great Falls,
will connect with the São Paulo-Rio Grande Railway at
União de Victoria and go on to São Francisco, called the
best port in Brazil south of Santos. However, the date of
this road’s completion is uncertain. The actual railway
junction is at Borja, a little south of Villa Rica, but the
latter place will receive the benefit. All of the towns are
what we might call large country villages.</p>

<p><b>Villa Concepción</b>, 130 miles up the river from Asunción,
the third if not the second city of commercial importance,
with a population given as 16, 25, also 30 thousand, is a port
for <i>yerba</i>, cattle, quebracho, and sugar. The town of one story
houses has better streets than those of the Capital, and a
comfortable inn. It may now boast of 50 automobiles,
instead of the one stylish turnout noted years ago by
Colonel Roosevelt.</p>

<p><b>Villa Encarnación</b>, population 15,000 or less, opposite
Posadas, is another city of commercial importance, as the
junction of the railway ferry and of river transportation.
Here there is a change of river boats, those of lighter draft
being required for the Upper Paraná.</p>

<p><b>Other towns</b> are Paraguarí on the railway between
Asunción and Villa Rica, Carapeguá near by, San Pedro
north of Asunción, half way to Concepción, Luque, nine
miles south of the Capital, and Pilar, well down the river.
Villa Hayes is one of several centres of commercial importance
in the Chaco.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span></p>

<p><b>San Bernadino</b> on Lake Ipacaraí, two hours from
Asunción, is a pleasure resort favored in winter by citizens
of Buenos Aires. A large modern hotel caters both to
fashionables and to sufferers from tuberculosis.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Transportation</span></h4>

<p><b>River</b> transportation in Paraguay is of the greatest
importance. Large comfortable steamers give good service
three times a week between Buenos Aires and Asunción,
making the trip upward in four or five days, down stream
in three. Above Asunción boats of suitable size and draft
give poorer service on the Paraguay. Several lines run
up 765 miles to Corumbá in Brazil, a three or four days
journey, calling on the way at several Paraguayan ports,
Concepción, 250 miles, San Salvador, Puerto Max, and
others. Fares are high, especially down stream, apparently
because one is obliged to go. Some ports on the Paraguay
and on a few branches above and below the capital are
visited by local steamers. Barges can be floated on over
2000 miles of internal rivers. <i>Chatas</i> (which are poled
along) drawing 2-4 feet of water carry 10-100 tons; such
boats on the Paraguay may carry 600 tons.</p>

<p>On the Alto Paraná, as previously stated, there is semi-weekly
service from Corrientes to Encarnación and Posadas.
Above, three times a week steamers, with many calls on both
sides of the river, make a four days’ journey to the Iguassú
and beyond to Puerto Mendez, from which point a short railway
in Brazil passes around La Guayra Falls.</p>

<p><b>Railway</b> facilities are increasing, construction though not
so easy as on the Argentine plains being less difficult than in
general in the other Republics. Nearly 475 miles of track
are in operation, 200 of them privately owned. The main
line of the Central Paraguay, Encarnación to Asunción, 230
miles, has first class equipment with through sleepers to
Buenos Aires, 966 miles from Asunción. Several short lines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
of very narrow gauge, about 30 inches, transport quebracho
and timber from the interior to river ports, 152 miles of these
in the Chaco. A railway of 40 miles serves sugar mills back
of Concepción. If the cross lines proposed to Brazil and
Bolivia (of one of the former some miles are in operation)
are constructed within the decade, a rapid development will
ensue. Cart roads are few and very poor. In wet weather
six or eight oxen are required for a cart. Two-wheeled
vehicles are much employed.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI<br><span class="small">PARAGUAY: RESOURCES AND INDUSTRIES</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The chief resources of Paraguay at present and for an
indefinite future are pastoral pursuits, forestry, and agriculture.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Forestry</span></h4>

<p><b>Quebracho.</b> The exploitation of quebracho is an important
source of wealth. On the estimated 27,000,000 acres
of forest land in the country are valuable woods of many
varieties, among which the quebracho is preëminent. The
first factory in South America for the extraction of tannin
from this wood was established in 1889 at Puerto Galileo in
the Chaco. The Forestal Company, British owned, was a
leader in the development of the industry in which one or
more American companies have lately become interested.
Large sums have been invested, $15,000,000 it is said by a
single company. Most of the properties are located in the
Chaco, which has great tracts of land distributed to individuals
or companies, some of whom have never seen their
holdings. One American company has 1,500,000 acres.</p>

<p>Unlike most other trees from which tannin is derived,
the tannin is not in the bark, but it permeates the entire
wood. Formerly the logs were exported, but this is now
forbidden. The International Products Company has a mill
at Puerto Pinasco on the west bank of the Paraguay above
San Salvador, and 300 miles north of San Antonio. The
wood is remarkably rich in tannin which runs 20 per cent.
The wood must be cut and then ground to extract the substance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
the refuse wood running the engines. One tree
weighing a ton will produce 600 pounds of extract. By
means of three rotary evaporators, the extract may be
solidified so as to be packed in bags, 75-100 tons of the solid
in 24 hours. The Company, owning enough wood to produce
450,000 tons, is equipped to supply 30,000 tons of the
extract annually. The trees are hauled by oxen to a light
railway which brings them to the port, the railway being
extended as the felling of the trees goes farther inland.
Twenty million pounds of extract were exported from Paraguay
in 1919.</p>

<p><b>Other Wood.</b> Several other trees have bark which is
used for tannin, among them the <i>curupay</i>, said to have 28 per
cent in the bark, which is used in Paraguay. This is one of
the strongest woods in the world, like quebracho much wanted
for railway ties. The <i>urunday</i> is a wood so durable that posts
of it in damp ground have lasted 200 years. Other woods
resemble the hickory, the English walnut, the soft pine, etc.
The <i>ivara-pitak</i> is a fine all around timber, light, tough, and
hard, an unusual combination. Lignum vitae (<i>palo santo</i>),
almost as hard as quebracho, cedar, and bitter orange abound,
the leaves of the latter used for essential oil, chiefly exported
to France. The hard woods are useful for railways, for cabinet
making, and fine furniture; also for firewood on account
of the enormous price of coal. From the proximity of the
forests to the coalless region of Argentina and its plains, mostly
treeless or supporting light woods only, like eucalyptus and
poplar, forestry is certain to have in Paraguay a speedy and
extensive development, in spite of the fact that there is a
great variety of trees growing in a small space, as 47 different
kinds among 163 trees in a tract 100 yards square. However,
in places in the Chaco the quebracho chiefly abounds.</p>

<p>Other woods found in the eastern forest are <i>ibiraro</i>, close
grained and flexible, the best for wheels, which made of this
wood last for years without tires, excellent also for boat and
ship building; the <i>caranday</i> or black palm 30 feet high, used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
for telegraph poles and scaffolding; <i>palo de rosa</i> (rosewood),
a mahogany used for cigar boxes; the <i>tatum</i>, good for clothes
boxes, being obnoxious to insects; and many more, valuable
but little known. Also there are fibre plants, ramie, jute, etc.</p>

<p><b>Yerba mate</b>, although now to some extent cultivated, is
chiefly a forestal product. Once known as Paraguay tea,
it is a famous product of the country, and in some sections
the most important.</p>

<p>The trees or shrubs grow wild in the forest to a height
of 10-25 feet; from these the bright green leaves are gathered
from which the tea is made. How to propagate the
trees was for years a mystery, but it is now known that
soaking the seed in hot water will promote germination.
If planted in tiny wooden boxes with no bottom, 9 inches
deep, the roots may be transplanted without injury. A
tree comes into bearing in five years, but reaches full production
only after 12 years. Some plantations have been
established on the Alto Paraná, but the greater part of the
<i>mate</i> comes from the virgin forest. The natural trees in the
forest grow better if that is cleared of underbrush and of the
larger trees. When full grown they can endure 5-6 cuttings
a year without permanent harm.</p>

<p>The Industrial Paraguay, with a capital of $5,000,000, is
said to export about 75 per cent of the total. This Company
holding a property of 8400 square miles, was the first to undertake
on a considerable scale the cultivation of <i>yerba mate</i> in
plantations. Their largest is in the north at Nueva Germania
on the River Acaray. Barthe and Company, with a property
of 3000 square miles, has a plantation near Nacunday on the
Paraná River with 1,400,000 trees producing, and 1,000,000
more immature. The plantations of 28,000 acres will soon
supply 5,700,000 pounds a year. <i>Mate</i> sold in 1918 at 8-10
cents a pound. In that year cultivated trees produced 6,700,000
pounds, and the natural 17,200,000 pounds. <i>Chatas</i>, flat boats,
carry the dried leaves down stream to river ports where they
are taken by steamers to Asunción, Posadas, Corrientes, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
Buenos Aires to be ground. The Industrial has two ports on
the Paraná and one on the Acaray, with mills in Asunción,
Corrientes, and Buenos Aires. La Matte Larangeira, a Brazilian
Company, has some <i>yerbales</i> in North Paraguay, but
more in Matto Grosso.</p>

<p>Ten to twelve million persons in South America drink <i>mate</i>,
though tea and coffee are more fashionable in the large cities.
Its use was spreading in Europe before the War, but few
persons in the United States are acquainted with its virtues.
Containing less tannin, it is more healthful than tea or coffee,
is soothing to the nervous system, and beneficial to digestion
unless taken to excess. When used instead of food it becomes
injurious. It is much drunk on the plains of Argentina, counteracting
the effects of an excessive meat diet. It may be made
like tea, but in its native haunts, the powder is put into a gourd
called a <i>mate</i>, boiling water is poured on, and after steeping
the liquid is drunk with a <i>bombilla</i>, a tube ending in an oval
ball, with small holes to admit the liquid, but supposed to keep
out the <i>yerba</i>.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Agriculture</span></h4>

<p><b>Tobacco</b>, largely cultivated in Paraguay, is the most important
agricultural product with the first place in foreign
trade. Almost every one smokes large cigars, even women
and girls. The leaves are divided into seven classes: the
first class called <i>pito</i> containing 2¹⁄₂ per cent of nicotine,
the seventh class 7 per cent. The first four classes are used
in Europe as fillers, the last three in Argentina as wrappers,
having larger, stronger leaves. The tobacco is mainly from
Havana seed introduced in 1900. The leaves are dried and
fermented, and made into various types of cigars, or shipped
in crude form to Europe, formerly the most to Germany,
later to France and Spain. Of one crop of 7000 tons 4000
went to Europe, there sold under different names. In
Argentina and Uruguay the cigars and cigarettes are popular
under the name of Paraguay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span></p>

<p><b>Small Farm Products.</b> Agriculture is naturally important
for home consumption, but aside from tobacco and
oranges the exports are slight. As almost everything will
grow in the rich soil, with increasing population agriculture
will become a great source of wealth. Mandioca and corn
are staple for the small farmer, the latter of two varieties,
a hard white and a soft yellow, the former of especial excellence
both for nutriment, and withstanding the ravages of
the grain weevil. Three crops a year may be raised from one
variety of sweet corn. White potatoes flourish, though not
so well as sweet, no great hardship. Beans, peanuts, millet,
and various European vegetables are raised for home consumption.
Wheat is experimental. Coffee does fairly but
is often injured by frost; alfalfa not so well as in Argentina.
Rotation of crops is unknown and few implements are employed.
Life is so easy that the small farmer is rather shiftless,
and practically nothing is done on a large scale.</p>

<p><b>Oranges</b>, grown by every one, are the most noteworthy
of the many varieties of fruit produced in Paraguay, but
high freight rates make them less profitable than they should
be. They grow freely and are exported in large numbers
to Argentina and Uruguay, 200,000,000 in 1919; they have
been called the best in the world. However, they do not
keep well, and being carelessly packed many are spoiled in
transportation. The introduction of hardier varieties is
talked of.</p>

<p><b>Sugar</b> finds excellent soil but is liable to suffer from
frost or drought. It is grown mostly in the north near the
rivers, railways, and factories. There are at least seven
mills, two at Villa Hayes in the Chaco, one at Concepción.
Some small mills make brown sugar and <i>caña</i>; 387,500 tons
were produced in 1918. About 20,000 acres were cultivated
in 1919, but some sugar is imported. The methods have
been crude but are improving.</p>

<p><b>Cotton.</b> Good cotton land exists especially in the southwest,
and in the Chaco. An indigenous tree bears 10-12<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
years. The staple is of good length and quality. Not
enough is produced to supply the home market, but its
culture is increasing. A Belgian obtained annually 1000
pounds an acre for six years. At present the seed is not
utilized.</p>

<p><b>Rice</b> is grown on low ground between the Paraguay
River and the railway. Two crops a year may be raised
giving 2000 pounds to the acre, a quantity which might be
nearly doubled. The coconut palm, peanut, and castor bean
flourish.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Stock Industry</span></h4>

<p>Cattle raising is beginning to be very profitable in Paraguay
as in the neighboring countries; and here there is a
chance for the small capitalist. Formerly some live cattle
were exported, but ten times as many hides; also dried
meat from <i>saladeros</i>. During the Great War operations were
carried on by three American companies. A plant at San
Salvador, nearly three hundred miles above Asunción, for
slaughtering cattle and putting up canned meat, was conducted
by Morris; another by Swift 5 miles above the Capital,
where over 900,000 six-pound cans of meat were put up
in 1918. But with the conclusion of the War the demand
fell off so rapidly that both plants are closed and dismantled.</p>

<p>A third establishment, however, at San Antonio, 15
miles below the Capital, is actively engaged and about to
increase its output. The International Products Company
has a thoroughly modern equipment, a real <i>frigorifico</i>, for the
export of frozen meat, with a capacity of 175,000 head of
cattle a year, to be shipped to Buenos Aires and Europe.
The cattle are in part purchased from individual farmers,
but the Company has a large property where its own production
is increasing. Nearly 300 leagues of land are owned
back of Puerto Pinasco in the Chaco: one half for cattle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
grazing and half quebracho lands. They have 600 miles
of barbed wire and a herd of 70,000 with some blooded
stock. The western section is used for young cattle which
are moved east the third year for fattening. The Company
besides tugs and lighters for the transport of the cattle
has two refrigerating steamers to carry the frozen meat
to Buenos Aires. The hides increase the value of the production.</p>

<p>The native cattle are far better than the Texas Longhorn,
but not equal to the blooded stock of Argentina. They
weigh 850-1000 pounds and afford excellent beef. The
Argentine is heavier but called coarser than that of the
United States. The Paraguay stock is now being improved
especially with Herefords. A 50 per cent increase of the
herd is general. It is estimated that the number of cattle
in Paraguay is now 5,000,000, and that 40,000,000 may be
easily supported. The native grasses are good, and the
<i>jaraguá</i> from Brazil is used. Stock may be bought at $15 a
head, perhaps less in large numbers, affording the best possible
opportunity for the small capitalist. The dairy industry
is slight, the native cows being poor milkers.</p>

<p>The Chaco land near the River is liable to floods but few
cattle are lost as there is usually time to drive them back
20-30 miles to the second and higher zone beyond the danger.
It has been said that cattle covered with ticks east of
the Paraguay on crossing into the Chaco soon become free
of them. A French company in 1919 had 150,000 head of
cattle with over 500 Hereford bulls, a breeding stock of
more than 100,000. One thousand miles of pasture were
enclosed. The Company makes use of 130 telephones, has
shops, a tannery, etc. Besides Herefords there are Durhams
and Polled Angus. Two hundred men are in charge of the
stock. The natives make good cowboys, better I was told
than some Americans who went down from here a few
years ago.</p>

<p><b>Other Stock.</b> As to other stock, horses are comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
few, not one tenth of the number of cattle, hardly
enough for home use. They are liable to disease and do not
thrive in the Chaco, better east of the River. Mules serve
well though smaller than in the United States. Horses are
outnumbered by sheep, which are valuable for meat, though
mutton is not favored by the natives. The climate is obviously
warm for sheep and their fleece is light. New stock
must be introduced. Hogs and goats thrive better.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Mining</span></h4>

<p><b>Iron</b>, 34 per cent pure, was produced at Ibicuy, 1863-69.
Indications of it are widespread near the Alto Paraná, and
near Caapacá, Quiquió, and Paraguarí.</p>

<p><b>Manganese</b> runs 63 per cent in beds of 60,000,000 tons.
Copper exists near Encarnación and Caapacá. There are
large beds of good stone, talc, graphite, kaolin. Probably
petroleum will be found in the Chaco.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Manufacturing</span></h4>

<p>Manufacturing is non-existent, aside from the quebracho
and sugar mills, save for a few necessities of life, as by
many regarded. Beer comes first with the largest investment
of capital, flour mills next, then boots and shoes, furniture,
brick, tiles, matches, hard and soft drinks, soap, vegetable
oils, etc. The opportunities are vast for the development
of electric power. Labor in general is fair and loyal,
undeveloped, but with good intelligence. The men lack
steadiness and a feeling of responsibility. There has been
less labor trouble than in Argentina and Chile, but men
from Argentina have been attempting to unionize them.
Strikes are common. Wages are from 50 cents to $3.00 a
day, the lower with quarters. At the <i>frigorificos</i> $1.00 is paid
with free rent, for ten hours’ daily work.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Investments</span></h4>

<p>Perhaps no other country of South America presents to
the small farmer and willing worker, with or without small
capital, openings more favorable than Paraguay, if equal to
these. Some stock raising for local use or for the packing
houses might gradually be added to agriculture. The dairy
industry ought to be profitable. Fruit raising for export or
for canning is undoubtedly of excellent promise; a large proposition
of this nature is now being considered by an American
corporation. Saw mills and lumbering would give good returns.
Small industries, well managed, might afford fair earnings.
For quebracho, <i>yerba mate</i>, or large scale stock raising, much
capital is required, yet a modest sum here might go farther for
stock than in any other country. Thousands of acres of land
suited to agriculture are available for colonists in accordance
with their liberal colonization and homestead laws. The price
goes from $1 to $13 an acre. Grazing land costs $2-$5, agricultural
$5-$20, Chaco land $1-$2.50 an acre. Special arrangements
are made for and with a party of colonists as in
all of the countries.</p>

POPULATION, PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</span></h3>
</div>


<p>Uruguay, still occasionally called the Banda Oriental (the
land east of the Uruguay River), is the smallest Republic of
South America.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Area, Population, Boundary</span></h4>

<p><b>Area.</b> With an area of 72,172 square miles, Uruguay is
larger than New England.</p>

<p><b>Population.</b> The country has now about 1,500,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p><b>Boundary.</b> Uruguay is nearly surrounded by water,
having the Atlantic Ocean for 120 miles on the east. The
river or estuary of La Plata 235 miles on the south, and the
Uruguay 270 miles on the west, both separate the country
from Argentina; on the north and east between Uruguay
and Brazil three rivers and Lake Mirím form the boundary
most of the way, with the Santa Hills for some distance.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">History</span></h4>

<p>In 1512 the explorer, Juan de Solis, entered the gulf-like
River Plata and landed upstream, 70 miles beyond Montevideo.
Here were found Charrúa Indians, accounted by the
Guaranís rather ferocious. On his next visit, 1515-16, Juan
de Solis was slain by them with all his party that had gone
on shore. It was many years later that permanent settlements
were made in this region by Portuguese or Spaniards
and not until 1726 was the city of Montevideo founded by
Spaniards. In 1777 a rival Portuguese settlement was driven
out by General Zavala of Buenos Aires. Subsequent to 1750<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
Montevideo was independent of Buenos Aires. After the
Junta was formed in that city in 1810 the Spanish Viceroy
for a short time had his seat at Montevideo; but the people
soon became eager for independence. Under Artigas they
waged war for years against the Spanish, the Portuguese,
and also the Porteños of Buenos Aires. When in 1824 the
power of Spain was finally destroyed in Peru, Uruguay alone
was not independent. Accordingly a refugee in Buenos
Aires, Lavalleja, with others, 33 in all (Treinta y Tres, a
popular name in Uruguay), set out from Argentina, crossed
the Uruguay River, gained adherents, captured Dolores, and
August 25, 1825, established a government at Florida. In
August, 1828, after many struggles Brazil and Argentina
both acknowledged the independence of Uruguay; and May,
1829, Lavalleja entered Montevideo. In 1830 the Assembly
elected Rivera President, after which Lavalleja tried to overthrow
the Government. Under the second President, Uribe,
one of the 33, a battle occurred when the colors red and
white were used by the opposing parties, from which date
the two parties: Red, Colorados, party of Rivera; Whites,
Blancos, of Uribe and Lavalleja. Strife continued, the
deaths of the leaders making no difference to the factions,
and the parties continuing to the present with these names.
In February, 1865, Flores, who had secured the support of
Brazil, became dictator, but Paraguay having been previously
asked to interfere continued the fight. Flores was
assassinated, in 1868 occurred a terrible visitation of cholera,
and in ’69 a financial crisis that ruined thousands. Troubles
continued; until within the last few years no President has
had an entirely peaceful term. In view of this fact the
development and prosperity of the country has been remarkable.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Government</span></h4>

<p>The government of the country is that of a centralized
republic with the usual divisions; the President is elected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
for four years and not eligible for reëlection. The new Constitution
which began to operate March 1, 1920, is unusually
radical in character, a tendency observed in Uruguay some
years ago. The Executive Power is shared by the President
and a National Commission of nine members elected by the
people. Some Members of the Cabinet are appointed by the
President, others by the Commission. Congress elects the
members of the Supreme Court, approves or rejects treaties.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
Bills may be presented to either Chamber by Cabinet Members,
who may take part in deliberations or be summoned
by a vote of one third to answer questions. A permanent
committee, two Senators and five Deputies, represents Congress
when it is not in session, and has power to convoke it.</p>

<p>The 19 Departments or States with approximate area,
population, and capitals, beginning at the northwest, are
given on the preceding page.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Population</span></h4>

<p>The population of Uruguay, about 1,500,000, is practically
of the Caucasian race with slight intermixture of
Indian and Negro. The Indian tribes previously inhabiting
the country were mostly exterminated, a few departing into
adjoining regions, a few of the milder tribes being absorbed
by their conquerors. In the north are some negroes near
the Brazilian border and some of mixed blood. More than
any other country of South America Uruguay is inhabited
by a homogeneous white population.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Education</span></h4>

<p>A fine educational system has been developed, with
primary and graded schools throughout the country, so that
hardly more than 25 per cent of the population is illiterate.
Primary education is free and obligatory. In the Capital
is a well equipped University with the usual Departments,
including Engineering and Architecture; a School of Arts
and Trades, kindergartens, and two Normal Schools; six
of the latter are found in other cities. In the suburb of
Montevideo is a School of Agriculture; four model farms are
located at Colonia, Salto, Paysandú, and Cerro Largo.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Press, Religion, etc.</span></h4>

<p><b>The Press</b> is of high character with a number of good
papers in Montevideo, and some in other cities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span></p>

<p><b>The Religion</b>, of course, is Roman Catholic, although
there is no State Church. Complete toleration exists for
other forms of worship.</p>

<p><b>Telegraph</b>, etc. The Government has about 4800 miles
of telegraph lines and four wireless stations. Wireless is
compulsory on all steamers visiting Uruguayan ports.
Telephones belonging to two private companies are likely
to be taken over by the Government; 19 towns have this
convenience.</p>

<p><b>Money.</b> The gold standard was long ago adopted, but
no gold was coined and no bullion is carried by the State.
In spite of this we have the curious fact that the paper peso
is equivalent to gold, and in ordinary times to $1.034 of our
money; though unhappily when once I received some of
the bills here, exchange being normal, I could obtain but
90 cents on the dollar for them. One broker even offered
me 80 cents. Subsidiary coins are of silver and nickel, and
a silver dollar is carried at par. The credit of Uruguay is
obviously excellent, and its bonds are often above par.</p>

<p><b>Weights</b> and <b>Measures</b> according to the metric system
are obligatory. The importation even of other weighing
apparatus is forbidden.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Physical Characteristics</span></h4>

<p>Uruguay is roughly a right-angled triangle in shape, its
apex at the northwest, the western boundary line nearly
perpendicular, the south side almost at right angles with
it, and the Brazilian boundary the hypothenuse; with a little
extra piece at the southeast bordering on the Atlantic. For
the most part a gently rolling country well suited to agriculture
as for cattle raising, it slopes towards the east, west,
and south; having rougher and higher land at the north,
where the greatest elevation is a little above 2000 feet. A
central cross depression is the Valley of the Rio Negro.
The perimeter of Uruguay measures 1148 miles, of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
668 are on the ocean or large rivers. The country is well
supplied with rivers, some of which are navigable. Besides
the Plata and Uruguay, there are the Negro, Tacuará,
Cebollati, Climar, and the Yaguarón; also Lake Mirím.
Besides Mirím on the Brazilian border there are a few lakes
along the ocean front; a few islands lie off the coast. The
country differs from the Argentine campo in having plenty
of stone.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Climate</span></h4>

<p>Extending from 30° to 35° South Latitude with no considerable
elevation and being close to the sea, Uruguay
naturally has a temperate climate with no great variation
over its limited area. The temperature generally ranges
from 40° to 90°. There is sufficient rainfall, about 40 inches,
and the country is well watered. Its coast offers agreeable
places for summer resorts, which are patronized both by
natives and by Argentines. The country in general has a
particularly salubrious climate, 244 sunny days, it is said,
in the year.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII<br><span class="small">URUGUAY: CAPITAL, DEPARTMENTS, CHIEF
CITIES, PORTS</span></h3>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Capital</span></h4>

<p><b>Montevideo</b>, the capital and chief port of Uruguay, with
a population approaching 400,000, is a pleasant city, a more
homelike place than Buenos Aires and preferred as a residence
by many, though doubtless more persons enjoy life
better in the larger gayer capital. Favorably situated near
the entrance, but on the Plata River, on a peninsula of high
ground which shelters a good harbor on the west, while
attractive beaches lie on the side towards the ocean, Montevideo
is in some respects a contrast to South America’s
metropolis, 100 miles distant, on the other shore. With fine
drainage facilities it is a clean healthful city, well lighted,
and well served by electric tramways. Pure water is brought
a distance of 30 miles. Though with fine buildings, theatres,
broad, well-paved avenues (150 miles of them), open squares,
and attractive parks, the city seems quite up to date, yet
somehow a trifle old fashioned, with an agreeable air of
solid respectability. The hotels are comfortable, but only
those facing the beaches, at a distance from the business
section, are really of the first class. An underground telephone
system is proposed.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Departments</span></h4>

<p><b>Canelones</b> is directly north and east of Montevideo,
extending along the River Plata. In proximity to the
Capital and with good rail connection, fruit growing and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
agriculture are important, viticulture is common; but even
here the pastoral industry leads. Canelones boasts of
several towns of 8000-10,000 population, one of which, Pando,
a pleasant agricultural centre, is connected with Montevideo
by a good macadamized road.</p>

<p><b>San José</b>, west of Montevideo and Canelones, has industries
similar to the latter with timber in addition, supplying
wood for fuel and for building.</p>

<p>The capital, San José, with a population of 15,000, has
the distinction of being the largest of the country towns as
distinguished from the ports. It has a good macadam road
to the capital, Montevideo, 60 miles, and an up-to-date flour
mill.</p>

<p><b>Colonia</b>, west of San José, running up to the entrance of
the Uruguay, is called the richest Department of the Republic.
Agriculture, dairy farming, fruit and viticulture are
well developed; its stone quarries are worked; and lying
opposite Buenos Aires, with good steamship service to that
city as well as rail connection with Montevideo, it is certain
of increasing prosperity.</p>

<p>The capital city of Colonia is a quiet old town with
historic associations; a new town three miles east has been
created as a pleasure resort. Colonia Suiza, with 4000
people and many Swiss chalets, is devoted to the dairy
industry; one enterprising proprietor who began as a milk
peddler now turns out from his factory in the spring one
ton of butter daily.</p>

<p><b>Soriano</b> on the Uruguay River, nevertheless has its chief
town, Mercedes, population 18,000, on a tributary, the Rio
Negro, here one-fourth of a mile wide. The main industry
is cattle raising; the town has a saladero and is also a
centre of charcoal making. Stone quarrying is carried on
in the Department and some minerals exist, topaz and
amethyst in considerable abundance. A peculiar water stone
is of curious and undetermined origin.</p>

<p><b>Rio Negro</b> follows on the north of the Negro River, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
chief centre for the breeding of live stock, as might be
expected from the fact that the capital is Fray Bentos, the
original home of the Liebig industry, beginning in 1865.
The company now owning nearly 5,000,000 acres, and establishments
elsewhere, Fray Bentos is of less relative importance
than formerly; yet with 180,000 cattle slaughtered
here in a single season, the business is considerable. It is
quite a model town, with good streets and homes for
employes, schools, etc.</p>

<p><b>Paysandú</b>, the next Department north, has a larger
population of which the capital of that name contains nearly
half, 22,000, being the second city of the Republic in commercial
importance. Electric lights and telephones are in
service, also horse cars. Here the stream narrows and this
is the last port of call for ocean steamers. The chief employments
in the Department are agricultural and pastoral;
there are some meat curing factories.</p>

<p><b>Salto</b>, Department and city, each with larger population
than the Department south, is also a pastoral region; but
it is rich in minerals, and is an important wine producing
district, where a great variety of other fruits, including
oranges, flourish well. Here the Uruguay River is bridged
to Concordia in Argentina, an important railway centre.
This is called the head of navigation, as here are falls and
rocks, but smaller boats ply the river above.</p>

<p><b>Artigas</b>, the most northern Department with a long
frontier on Argentina and Brazil both, has some railway
service, though not the main line to Brazil. The capital,
Artigas, population 10,000, is on the Brazilian border. This
Department has more timber, hard and soft, and less agriculture
and grazing. Some districts are noted for minerals
and precious stones.</p>

<p><b>Rivera</b> is next along the Brazilian border, one of the
largest Departments. The capital, population 15,000, is a
clean, well paved town, of growing importance as the
terminus of the Central Uruguay Railway, here connecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
with the Brazilian Railway to São Paulo. The Department,
though thinly peopled, has considerable agriculture
and gold mines of importance.</p>

<p><b>Tacuarembó</b>, directly south, largest of all the Departments,
is the most sparsely populated. It is chiefly devoted
to agriculture; tobacco flourishes, and rice culture has met
with some success. Gold and manganese are found.</p>

<p><b>Cerro Largo</b> next to Rivera on the Brazilian border is
chiefly pastoral with agriculture advancing. Its prosperity
is likely to increase with connection with Brazil now
planned from the capital, Melo, 14,000 population, the
present railway terminus.</p>

<p><b>Treinta y Tres</b>, its capital with 8000 population, is chiefly
pastoral with very little agriculture; it is well wooded with
valuable timber. The great Lake Mirím along the eastern
border is of much value, and further railway construction
will promote development.</p>

<p><b>Rocha</b>, south of Treinta y Tres, has also a long eastern
frontier on the Lake, a bit of Brazil, and much on the
Atlantic. Grazing is the chief industry with some viticulture.
Seal fishery is important, and there are minerals:
copper, gypsum, alabaster, marble, jasper.</p>

<p><b>Maldonado</b>, south of Rocha and east of Canelones, also
borders on the ocean at the southeast. Chiefly pastoral,
the Department has some agriculture and wine making.
There is seal fishing on the islands off the coast. Timber
will soon be important as tree planting is encouraged by
the Government. The British Consul received a gold medal
for planting over 10,000 maritime pines. The beginning
was difficult, the young trees being continually buried in
masses of sand. Dunes are characteristic of this coast.
But when the trees were once established continuance was
easy and now 100,000 or more are flourishing in this section.
Others followed the example, making land formerly worthless
now rated at $5-$25 an acre. Piriápolis, a new town
west of the capital city, is a remarkable place due to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
patriotic energy of Señor Piria, who here began planting
trees over 20 years ago. These are now a forest, with
millions of trees, seven miles of eucalyptus woodland
stretching from the Piria castle to the ocean, near which a
hotel has been erected and chalets, the beginning of a
prosperous town and summer resort. A railway serves this
western edge of Maldonado.</p>

<p><b>Minas</b> is back of Maldonado and west of Rocha. It has
pastoral and agricultural industries with a good endowment
of minerals.</p>

<p><b>Florida</b>, west of Minas and north of Canelones, abounds
in cattle and is developing agriculture.</p>

<p><b>Durazno</b>, north, in the centre of the Republic, is also
chiefly devoted to cattle raising.</p>

<p><b>Flores</b>, west of Durazno, is not well populated and is
chiefly pastoral.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Ports</span></h4>

<p><b>Ocean Ports.</b> The only ocean port of importance in
Uruguay is Montevideo and this indeed is on the Plata
River. It ranks, however, among the best in South America
in depth, capacity, and ease of access, admitting ships of 32-foot
draft at low tide. A free port for goods in transit,
where they may remain a year in the Custom House without
tax, it has excellent docks and harbor works, including
ample warehouses and facilities for handling all classes of
merchandise, 1400 tons unloaded in ten hours. A port railway
serves to connect sea and land traffic, transferring
passengers as well as freight directly from steamers to railway
cars. The port works constructed by the French,
concluded for the most part before the War, cost in the
neighborhood of $40,000,000. In the vicinity a Hotel for
Immigrants accommodates 1000.</p>

<p>Ships of many lines call in passing, passenger steamers
for Buenos Aires and many which do not go up the river,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
either because of too heavy draft, or to save time when on
the way to the West Coast or to other ports. For some
this is the ultimate destination. Nightly trips between the
two great cities are made by steamers of the Mihanovich
Line, which rival all but the finest plying between New
York and Boston. Smaller steamers sail from here or pause
on their way up the Uruguay, or the Paraná and the Paraguay,
the latter perhaps going through to Corumbá, 1800
miles, those for the Uruguay at most 300 miles to Salto or
Concordia.</p>

<p><b>River Ports.</b> Montevideo would strictly come under
this head. Others of importance are Colonia on the Plata
and Paysandú on the Uruguay, to which ocean steamers of
14-foot draft may ascend; to Salto beyond, steamers of 8-foot
draft. Above the rapids at Salto on the Uruguay and
on a few of its branches smaller steamboats and other craft
are used. The Rio Negro is navigable 50 miles to the
town of Mercedes. The entire fluvial navigation is 700
miles. The Uruguay Navigation Company with a capital
of $10,000,000 has recently been organized for traffic on the
Plata, Paraná, Uruguay, and Paraguay Rivers.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Railways</span></h4>

<p>Even more than in Argentina the railways have been
developed by British capital. The first concession in 1865
was for a road from Montevideo to the Rio Negro. Construction
has been more expensive than on the plains of
the neighboring Republic, on account of rolling country
and the many bridges required, over 300. There is a single
tunnel, in the Department Rocha. Happily all of the railways
are of the same gauge, the standard, 4 feet 8¹⁄₂ inches.
The length of those in operation is 1680 miles, the greatest
in proportion to area of any country in South America.</p>

<p><b>The Central Uruguay</b>, with its extensions, is the main
line from which most of the others branch. The original
ran from Montevideo to the Rio Negro in the centre of the
Republic, from which it was prolonged to the northern
border at Rivera. In May, 1917, closer connection was
established with Sant’ Anna, across the Brazilian border,
and sleeping car service to São Paulo in 4¹⁄₂ days, which
should shortly be 3¹⁄₂. The prolongation is called the
Northern Extension. The Eastern Extension starts at
Toledo, 16 miles from Montevideo, diverging to San Ramón,
Nico Peréz, and Melo, with a branch from Nico Peréz, to
Treinta y Tres, 311 miles in all. The Western Extension
runs from San José on a branch of the Central, to Mal
Abrigo and Mercedes. From Abrigo a line goes to Rosario<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
and Puerto del Sauce, and from Rosario on to Colonia,
altogether 211 miles.</p>

<p>Other roads are the Midland and the Northwestern, the
former connecting with the Central near the Rio Negro,
passing west to Paysandú, then north to Salto, while the
Northwestern runs 113 miles from Salto to Cabellos, then
northwest to the corner of the Republic, there connecting
by an international bridge across the Cuareim River with
Quarahim, Brazil, and its Great Southern Railway running
northward. At Salto there is considerable interchange of
traffic with Argentina through Concordia opposite, an
important railway junction and city. At Cabellos connection
is made with the Uruguay Northern, another road
running to the Brazilian Boundary, the terminus San
Eugenio.</p>

<p><b>The Uruguay East Coast Railway</b> with 78 miles of road,
starting from Olmas on the Central Uruguay runs to Maldonado.
Much of the traffic is to the seaside resorts, Puente
del Este and Piriápolis; there is also considerable freight
for the Montevideo market, of agricultural and pastoral
products and fish. An extension northward from San
Carlos to Rocha is authorized. The road has been purchased
by the Government. A line from Durazno on the Central
to Trinidad, begun by the Farquhar-Pearson Syndicate as
part of a line designed to cross the country diagonally from
Colonia to the Brazilian border, was taken over by the
Government, which has in view the securing of a system
of State railways. Besides building the 31-mile line from
San Carlos on the East Coast Railway it intends purchasing
the 23-mile line from Rocha to the port Paloma. Further
needed construction is planned by the Government as
soon as may be practicable.</p>

<p><b>Aeroplane service</b> is to be installed by a British company
from Montevideo to Rio de Janeiro and Pernambuco, and
aerial postal service is planned for the interior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Resources and Industries</span></h4>

<p><b>Stock raising</b> is by far the leading industry, as is evident
from the fact that in 1917 nearly 98 per cent of the exports
were of stock products. Of the 44 million acres devoted to
livestock and agriculture the latter occupies hardly 5 per cent.
In 1603, 100 cattle and two herds of horses were brought
into the country; the cattle increased so rapidly that at one
time they were killed for their hides, as more recently in
Paraguay. Since 1860 when Durham bulls were imported
and stock breeding began, much advance has been made in
quality. Herefords, Devon, a few Polled Angus and others
have also been imported; some for dairy purposes, as Swiss
and Flemish. In 1917 the cattle numbered about 8,000,000.
The best <i>estancias</i> have sheds to house pedigreed stock, they
plant trees and have cattle dips. Societies encourage scientific
breeding and the Government subsidizes agricultural shows.
One <i>estancia</i> of 60,000 acres has 15,000 cattle, 20,000 sheep,
some horses, and pays dividends of 16-25 per cent on a capital
of £120,000. Another company with 40,000 acres and a capital
of £40,000 pays dividends of 14-20 per cent. At least 20,000
acres are devoted to dairy farming; 50,000 pounds of butter are
made monthly, and both butter and cheese are exported. The
best of apparatus is employed.</p>

<p><b>Sheep</b>, imported from Argentina in 1608, flourish to the
number of 11,700,000; the varieties of Merino, Lincoln,
Romney Marsh are found among others, the English breeds
being preferred.</p>

<p><b>Horses</b> of good quality are raised, 570,000, both light and
heavy, but few in comparison to the cattle. There are 300,000
pigs, a few mules, 16,000, and 12,000 goats.</p>

<p><b>Meat Packing.</b> In 1754 the first meat salting plant was
established but the true pioneer dates from 1786. Others
followed. There are now 13 besides seven factories for preserving
meat and two <i>frigorificos</i>. The slaughter season is
from November to January. The meat for <i>saladeros</i> is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
separated from the bones, dried 4-6 days in the sun, and then
salted. It is arranged in four grades according to fat or lean;
the fat meat is sent to Brazil, the lean to Cuba and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Of <i>frigorificos</i> the Swifts own one, and exported to Europe
in 1915 and 1916, each, over 700,000 frozen quarters of beef
and 100,000 chilled; also mutton and lamb. The <i>Frigorifica
Uruguaya</i> shipped nearly 44,000,000 pounds of beef to Europe
in 1916 and over 2,000,000 pounds of mutton. The total
export of animal products shipped in 1916 was worth $73,000,000.
A model slaughter house and cold storage plant
is in prospect. A new one for wool washing has a capacity
of 132,000 pounds daily. Saving in freight cost and immunity
from deterioration are thereby attained.</p>

<p>The Liebig Extract of Beef Company, with extensive
holdings in and near Fray Bentos and with a total capitalization
of £2,000,000 usually pays 20 per cent dividends
on the ordinary shares; 5 per cent in 1916. They use the
best of meat, and their Oxo capsules and Lemco have a
world-wide reputation. They own and rent in Uruguay,
Argentina, and Paraguay 1,120,000 acres.</p>

<p>In spite of strikes and labor troubles the livestock
industry has brought prosperity to the country, with record
prices for beef, mutton, hides, and wool, thus greatly increasing
land values. The cattle are pastured on the natural
long thick grass, very little alfalfa being cultivated. Hogs,
hens, bees, and silkworms are raised. The seal industry and
fisheries are important.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Agriculture</span></h4>

<p>The agricultural products are insufficient for the use
of the country although 2,000,000 acres are in cultivation.
About 900,000 acres are in wheat, 700,000 in corn, 128,000
in flax, 100,000 oats, some barley and canary seed. In 1916
agricultural exports were valued at $1,500,000. Among
other crops are tobacco, which is especially promising, linseed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
alfalfa, sugar cane, some cotton, potatoes, etc. Viticulture
is quite extensive, American grapes growing better
in the south, and French and Italian in the north. Other
fruits, oranges, olives, apples, pears, cherries, peaches, and
melons flourish.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Forestry</span></h4>

<p>Forestry is encouraged so far as planting is concerned;
about 1,000,000 acres are in natural forest land. Millions
of trees have been planted on land not otherwise useful.
The supply of wood in future will be greatly increased and
there may even be export.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Minerals</span></h4>

<p>Minerals are of some importance and may become of
more. The country is believed to contain considerable
wealth in gold, silver, coal, marble, jasper; and in other
minerals and semi-precious stones, including amethyst and
topaz. There is little export save sand, stone for paving,
and similar articles.</p>

<p><b>Gold.</b> The chief gold fields are in the Department
Rivera near Cuñapiru not far from the Brazilian border.
A district 35-40 miles long and 7 wide contains auriferous
reef with gold 5 ounces to the ton; if deep the prospect is
limitless. A modern English plant is now getting out gold.
Bars worth $4000 were exported in 1915. Four hundred
mines have been denounced in the Department. Enormous
quantities of manganese are in the neighborhood. Gold is
found also in Minas, Salto, and Tacuarembó.</p>

<p>Copper exists in quantity in Cerro Largo, Maldonado,
Minas, Paysandú, and Salto. Iron, silver, slate, gypsum,
asbestos, lead, etc. may be exploited later. Even greatly
needed coal of fair quality has been found in Montevideo,
Santa Lucía, and especially in Cerro Largo where it seems
promising, though no working of minerals is sufficiently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
developed to present decisive results. Indications of
petroleum have been noted at the north, the strata coming
in from Brazil.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Manufactures</span></h4>

<p>Naturally manufacturing save for home consumption is
of slight importance, except of products of the pastoral
industry, as of dairies and of meat extract. For home use
there are 115 flour mills, 45 others, as of hardware, soap,
macaroni; 1 sugar factory, 3 starch, 1 cement, 4 breweries.
Many of these are in Montevideo. The Government proposes
the construction of chemical factories for the production
of sulphuric, nitric, carbolic, and acetic acid, glycerine,
benzol, alcohol, sulphuric ether, etc., and a powder and
explosive factory; these to cost over $2,000,000, material
and machinery to enter free of duty.</p>

<p>An important project of the Government is the development
of water power from the cataracts of the Uruguay
River, which will be equivalent to 3,000,000 tons of coal per
annum. Two dams are planned, one movable and one fixed,
with canals by which 419 miles of river will be open to
navigation from the lower section. Irrigation is included
in the project, and 37,000 acres near Montevideo are to be
irrigated as an illustration. Fifteen cities have authorized
work in connection with this project.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Investments</span></h4>

<p>Aside from the development of hydro-electric power and
the construction of public works of various kinds including
railways, it is probable that agriculture and fisheries present
the most favorable openings, with good possibilities also
in manufacturing industries, stone cutting, and mining.
Stock raising is already pretty well developed.</p>

</div>


<p>The country of Brazil, largest of the South American
Republics, has also a greater area than the United States
without Alaska, and is more than three-fourths the size
of all Europe. It cannot therefore be considered as a whole
so easily as the other Republics. It is essential to differentiate
between the various regions and States; for the dissimilarity
is not confined to climate and productions; or to
the character of the people, by reason of some being indigenous
and others of European descent. It arises in part
from the long coast line and the difficulty of land communication;
in part from the fact that in some districts
the population is almost entirely of European descent while
in others there is a large percentage of negro blood; as well
as from differences in physical and climatic conditions.
Thus the Capital is not so markedly the centre of the
Republic as in Argentina, and the States are more loosely
bound together than in the other Republics. The States
and the character of the people may be said to differ as
much among themselves as the countries of the West Coast
from each other, a point of importance to notice in commercial
relations.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Area, Population, Boundary</span></h4>

<p><b>Area.</b> Brazil covers a surface of 3,112,453 square miles.
Its length, 2750 miles, is about that of Chile; its extreme
width, 2560 miles, is ten times at great. The coast-line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
is much longer, 4140 miles. A considerable portion of this
immense area is still but superficially explored.</p>

<p><b>Population.</b> According to the cabled report of the census
of 1920, Brazil has 30,553,509 inhabitants. Its population,
therefore, exceeds that of any other South American
Republic even more largely than its area.</p>

<p><b>Boundary.</b> The boundary of the country, though
familiar from that of the others, may be rehearsed. On
the north we find Colombia, Venezuela, and the three
Guianas with the Atlantic beyond; on the east and southeast
the Atlantic only, on the south Uruguay, a speck of
Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, a bit of Peru; on the west
a small corner of Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, and Peru.
The only countries of the continent not touching its border
are Ecuador and Chile. However, a few writers mention
Ecuador on the west, as the southeast boundary line of that
country is still undetermined.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">History</span></h4>

<p>The first of the South American countries to be discovered
after Colombia and Venezuela, it was to the region
of Brazil that the name America was first applied. It is
therefore especially unbecoming for us to appropriate to
ourselves in any exclusive sense the title of Americans;
though having no other name, with apologies to the others,
it may be pardonable for us to employ it when necessary.</p>

<p>In the year 1500 the first landing on this part of the
continent was made by Pedro Alvares Cabral, then on his
way from Portugal to the West Indies. In commemoration
of that event, May 3rd is a Brazilian national holiday and
the date of the assembling of Congress. As soon as the
news was received in the home country, an expedition was
sent out under Amerigo Vespucci, who explored the coast
from its eastern extremity almost to La Plata, nearly 2000
miles. Fifteen Captaincies, each 150 miles along the coast,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
were later allotted and settlements were begun. The earliest
of these which rose to importance were São Vicente in
the neighborhood of Santos, and Pernambuco; a little later,
Bahia and Rio de Janeiro. These were the first agricultural
colonies to be founded in South America, gold and silver
being the attraction elsewhere. The French also had an
eye to this country, making a settlement at Rio de Janeiro;
the Dutch as well, who about a century later captured Bahia
and Pernambuco; but both were ultimately expelled, the
whole country remaining in the hands of the Portuguese.
Conflicts with the Indians took place, at first with some who
were unfriendly, and afterwards through attacks made by
the invaders upon those Indians who had been christianized
by the Jesuits. Their settlements were destroyed, 300,000
are said to have been slaughtered, and the rest were driven
by the Paulistas from the region of the upper Paraná.</p>

<p>As Philip II of Spain in 1581 became ruler of Portugal,
during the 60 years following, the expansion of Brazil to
the west in territory which had been assigned to Spain
was permitted, and such possession remained permanent.
At other times conflicts occurred with the Spaniards at the
south, but in 1777 peace was made with the boundaries as
at present.</p>

<p>In 1807, Prince João, fleeing from Napoleon, came with
his court to Brazil. He soon opened the five chief ports to
commerce, he encouraged science, education, literature, art,
and the immigration of foreigners, thus inaugurating a
development of permanent value. On his return to Europe
in 1821, the Prince, in view of the revolts of the Spanish
colonies, hinted to his son whom he left in charge the
advisability of himself assuming the crown, if a disposition
towards independence became manifest. Accordingly in
1822, the son was crowned Emperor of Brazil; but having
alienated his supporters, in 1831 he abdicated in favor of
his infant son, Pedro. In 1889, the old Emperor, Dom
Pedro II, who for many years had ruled wisely and well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
was expelled on 24 hours’ notice; after a brief interim a
Republic was established in 1891. Extravagance, insurrections,
and financial distress followed, but since 1900 the
country has made rapid advancement in wealth and in
varied lines of development.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Government</span></h4>

<p>The government is a federalized republic with the
usual branches, the States more loosely bound together
than with us, or than in any other South American Republic.
They may even fix export taxes, and levy stamp duties.
The President, with a Vice President, is elected for four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
years and is ineligible for a succeeding term. He has a
Cabinet of seven Ministers. Congress is composed of a
Senate with 63 members and a Chamber of 212 Deputies.
There are 20 States, a Federal District, and the Territory
of Acre. The last is composed of three Prefectures, with
capital cities where government is administered by Government
appointees. The States have their own administrative
bodies, some with one house of legislation, some with
two; and with a Governor or President as chief executive,
a slight confusion possibly arising at times where the latter
term is employed. All male citizens over 21 may vote
except illiterates, soldiers, beggars, and members of
monastic orders subject to vows of obedience, a wise prescription.
The list of States precedes, with the usual figures,
as accurate as obtainable, the areas from the latest Government
survey. The list begins at the northwest, goes down
the coast, and follows with the interior.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Population</span></h4>

<p>The population, by the recent census 30,553,509, is of a
more varied character than that of Uruguay and Argentina
at the south. Some figures given are 52 per cent white, 26
mixed, 13 Indian, and 9 per cent negro. The original
settlers were Portuguese, and at first immigration was from
the mother country. In the early days many negroes were
imported from Africa as slaves, yet there was little color
prejudice so that the number of mulattoes and lighter as
well as of negroes in some sections is very large.</p>

<p>During the last hundred years over 3,000,000 immigrants
have arrived, of whom the Italians formed the larger proportion;
next in number were the Portuguese, half as many
Spaniards; those of other nationalities included 100,000
Germans, and a small colony from our Southern States, who
left in disgust in 1867. The negroes, freed in 1888 and
endowed with suffrage, were less qualified for it than in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
United States. While some have made good advancement
others have relapsed into a worse condition, being able in
many parts of the country to exist on almost nothing.
Indolence is a failing among many of all complexions, as
is natural in tropical regions; on the other hand many
Brazilians even in the warmer sections are characterized
by great activity and industry. In the large cities culture
and elegance are noticeable and aristocracy of birth is
cherished. In some regions the inhabitants are less pretentious,
live more simply, and practise the homely virtues;
the most primitive section according to Oakenfull is between
the São Francisco River and Maranhão. Women in general
are more secluded than in some of the other Republics.
The Brazilians have much literary and artistic taste and
as a rule are punctilious in courtesy, though exceptions may
be noted.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Education</span></h4>

<p>Education is highly regarded in Brazil. Primary and
secondary are free and secular, generally provided by the
States and Municipalities. The Federal Government administers
several Professional Schools as of Medicine, Law,
Engineering, etc., and many of Agriculture in various parts
of the country. With some of these, local schools are
affiliated, as Schools of Law, of Applied Science, at Rio of
Social Science, at Recife Engineering, etc. The different
States spend 4-21 per cent of their revenue on primary
education, averaging above ten. The Federal District
spends 28 per cent. There are also private schools in different
cities, several English or American; the American
Mackenzie College at São Paulo is affiliated with the University
of the State of New York.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Press, Religion, etc.</span></h4>

<p><b>The Press</b> is influential and of high quality, the leading
papers of Rio, São Paulo, and other cities comparing well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
with those of cities of corresponding size in other parts of
the world.</p>

<p><b>Religion.</b> In Brazil there is entire separation of Church
and State and absolute religious freedom. Civil marriage
alone is recognized.</p>

<p><b>Post and Telegraph.</b> Brazil has 3700 Post Offices.</p>

<p>Telegraph wires (over 26,000 miles) are in part national;
other lines belong to the railways; there are submarine
cables, and one up the Amazon. Wireless stations have
been installed at many points on the coast and in the
interior, including the Amazon district, as at Manaos and
beyond. Telephones are to be found in all cities of any
considerable size, about 80 systems.</p>

<p><b>Money</b> is more complicated and bothersome than in
any of the other countries, the unit being of 1000 instead
of 100 parts, as is usual. Thus the milreis, written 1$000,
equals 1000 reis as the name indicates. The milreis of gold
is equal to 54.6 cents, but exchange varies, and the paper
in common use varies from its ordinary value, 33.3 cents,
to half that or even less in disturbed conditions. A conto
of reis, a term often used, is 1000 milreis, and is written with
a colon, thus: 5 contos, 20 milreis, and 300 reis would be
written 5:20$300.</p>

<p><b>The Metric System</b> is legal and compulsory, but in some
places, the old Portuguese measures persist; these differ
from the Spanish. A vara in Peru is less than a yard, but
in Brazil it is 1.111 metre, or 1.215 yard. A libra is 4.695
kilos; an alquiere varies from 24 to 160 litres. Other
variety exists in the same or in different places.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLVI">CHAPTER XLVI<br><span class="small">BRAZIL: PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</span></h3>
</div>


<p>Brazil presents in physical characteristics more variety
than is generally supposed. As the great Amazon Basin
is in striking contrast to the immense Andean Range, the
entire country is thought of as hot. Since it extends from
5° 10′ N. Lat. to 33° 45′ S. Lat. with the widest part near
the equator, the greater portion of the territory is evidently
in the torrid zone, 11° only in the temperate, with more
than twice that in the tropics. However, in this comparatively
low country, there is happily a variation in altitude
sufficient to affect the climate and to give rise to variety
in productions; to which diversity the 11° in the temperate
zone also contribute. The territory may be considered
as in four general sections: the Amazon Basin, the Plata
(the two almost connected over low elevations), the Coastal
Belt, and a mass of mountains and highlands along the
coastal states, extending also at a lower level across to
Bolivia. In addition there are the Guiana Highlands at the
north.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Coastal Belt</span></h4>

<p>The coastal section is largely a low-lying sandy tract,
varied by swamp lands overgrown with palms or other
verdure, and slopes covered with dense tropical vegetation.
Without deep indentations in the form of gulfs and bays
there is a considerable number of good harbors. In the far
south two large lakes have been created which are connected
with the ocean. The coastal strip varies in width
from one to 100 miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Guiana Highlands</span></h4>

<p>Of the mountainous regions, the range forming the
boundary line with Venezuela and Guiana on the north
with its offshoots and the country between has attracted
little interest and been but slightly explored. From Mt.
Roraima, 8500 feet, at the corner of Venezuela and British
Guiana, the range lowers toward the East, the highest point
on the French frontier being about 2600 feet. South of this
are broken ranges and deep river courses on the Brazilian
plateau, which with an altitude of 2000 feet slopes south
and east. Excepting the part near the coast, this section
called Brazilian Guiana is semi-arid, on account of the
mountains extracting the moisture from the northeast trade
winds. Inhabited by a few roving bands of Indians and
in the east visited by white mining adventurers, it has been
deemed one of the least attractive parts of the Republic.
Recent exploration, however, has reported an extent of
valuable forest lands and immense areas of open country
suited to cattle ranges. A railway from British Guiana is
talked of to render this district accessible to the outside
world.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Plateau and Mountain Region</span></h4>

<p>An important part of Brazil is the plateau region (altitude
1000-3000 feet) south of the Amazon, especially that
portion extending along the coastal states. The greater
part of the central section was once covered with a thick
sandstone sheet, now deeply eroded by numerous rivers
which have left high flat ridges between the lower basins.
The true mountain systems which rise from the plateau
are parallel ranges following the coast, and the Central or
Goyana system. An almost continuous range, the Serra do
Mar, stretches from Rio Grande do Sul to Cape Frio, just
east of Rio de Janeiro; beyond this, farther from the coast,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
broken sections extend well towards Cape St. Roque in
Rio Grande do Norte. The highest point in the Serra do
Mar or Coast Range is 7223 feet in the Organ Mountains
near Rio, as the capital city is often called for short and
may be so understood when here used.</p>

<p>A second parallel range runs from Eastern São Paulo
northeast and north to the point where the São Francisco
River turns east in Bahia; Itatiaiá, 9823 feet, in Rio de
Janeiro State, is its culminating point in Brazil. West of
the São Francisco River is the Central or Goyaz Range,
also in two branches, running from the southern part of
Goyaz northeast, one branch across western Minas Geraes,
the other in Goyaz with highlands extending far north
separating the Tocantins Basin from the São Francisco,
and in the south separating it from the Paraná. The highest
point is near the city of Goyaz, Mt. Pyraneus, 7750 feet.
How the great table-land has been broken down by rivers
is shown by the Tocantins-Araguaya Basin excavated
northward for 700 miles. From 100 to 500 miles wide, it
is from 10 to 1500 feet deep.</p>

<p>The eastern margin of the plateau is near the Atlantic
where it breaks off suddenly with an average height of
2600-3200 feet. This plateau is the best part of the country,
the Atlantic slope heavily wooded, the more gradual west
slope with many grass covered plains. A fertile soil, rich
forests, and regular rainfall make this a favored region.
Farther north than Minas Geraes, the section has less rain,
is thinly wooded in places, with large areas suited to grazing
but subject to drought. The plateau extends across
Brazil north of Paraguay abruptly breaking down from a
height of 2600-3000 feet towards the Paraná and Paraguay
Basins. It has a gradual slope towards the Amazon, the
parts excavated by the rivers having lowland characteristics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Amazon Basin</span></h4>

<p>The section of the Amazon Basin is indeed immense.
The whole drainage area with that of the Tocantins, generally
included though not strictly a component part,
spreads over 2,700,000 square miles, much of it as we have
already seen outside of Brazil, and occupying two-fifths of
South America. This area is greater than the basins of the
Mississippi, Missouri, Danube, and Nile, all combined. The
course of one tributary to the sea is 3200 miles. Of the
55 largest rivers in the world, it is said that 33 are mainly
if not wholly in Brazil. Twenty-seven thousand miles of
navigable rivers are found in the country, the greater part
connected with the Amazon, which is itself navigable for
ocean steamers to Iquitos, Peru, a distance of 2300 miles,
and 486 miles farther for vessels of 14 feet draft. The true
mouth of the Amazon is west and north of the Marajos
Island which is greater in area than Holland or Belgium,
while the Pará River at the south and east is the mouth of
the Tocantins. This, however, is the usual entrance for
Amazon steamers even when they do not wish to call at
Pará, for this river is connected by natural channels among
islands with the greater stream, and the northern entrance
has too strong a current to be desirable for navigation. As
a matter of convenience the Tocantins is generally included
with the Amazon in descriptions. The depth of the estuary
is 90-900 feet, averaging 150.</p>

<p><b>The Tocantins River</b> is a great artery of Brazil flowing
from south to north a distance of 1600 miles, with a west
affluent, the Araguaya, almost its equal in size and 1000
miles long above the union. Both rivers receive many tributaries.
The flat broad valleys are overlooked by steep
bluffs. The cataracts and rapids which occur on nearly
all of the rivers as they come down from the plateau greatly
interfere with navigation, but in their lower courses many
are navigable for hundreds of miles, the Tocantins for 130.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span></p>

<p><b>The Xingú</b>, the next river, with a length of 1260 miles
is the first true tributary of the Amazon on the south. This
also flows nearly north with many rapids and at last a
fall, Itamaracá, at the head of navigation, 105 miles from
its mouth. Near this the river expands into a great lake
which communicates with the Amazon by many natural
channels.</p>

<p><b>The Tapajós</b>, 1158 miles long, entering the Amazon
about 500 miles above Pará, rises near Diamantino on the
plateau, and flows through a long, hot, unhealthful valley.
One hundred and eighty-eight miles are navigable, the lower
100 of these being 4-9 miles wide and throughout much of
its course very deep. Along the lower river valley are bluffs
300-400 feet high.</p>

<p><b>The Madeira</b>, entering 870 miles above Pará, almost
rivals the Amazon in volume. In the rainy season, during
which it rises 50 feet, the largest ocean steamers may ascend
665 miles to the falls of Santo Antonio and the Madeira-Mamoré
Railway; from June to December it is navigable
for vessels of 5-6 foot draft only. Tributary to the Madeira
on the east is the river formerly called the Duvida, first
completely traversed by Colonel Roosevelt and his party
and now named in his honor Rio Roosevelt. The Madeira
which has 90 tributaries and a basin of over 600,000 square
miles is formed a little higher up by the junction of the Beni
and Mamoré, both of which streams rise close to the head
waters of the Paraguay. From Santo Antonio south, the
Madeira-Mamoré is obstructed for 263 miles by a series of
rapids and cataracts, the Madeira Falls, where the Beni
comes in, presenting a vast display of whirlpool and boiling
torrents. Above Santo Antonio the drainage is received of
the southwest slope of the State of Matto Grosso, the north
slope of the Chiquitos Sierras, and the northeast slope of the
Andes from Santa Cruz de la Sierra in Bolivia to Cuzco in
Peru. The most important of the affluents are the Guaporé,
Baurés, Itonamas, Mamoré, Beni, and Madre de Dios. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
almost level Mojos and Beni plains are said to rival if not
to exceed in fertility the Nile Valley; they are the most
healthful and most inviting grazing and agricultural regions
in the Amazon Basin, which has an area about equal to that
of France and Spain. However, 35,000 square miles are
flooded 2-3 feet, three or four months every year.</p>

<p><b>The Purús</b>, over 2000 miles in length, is a very sluggish
stream parallel to the Madeira, in the great depression
between the Brazilian plateau and the Andes. A peculiar
feature is five parallel canals coming into it from the
Amazon northwest at almost regular intervals, making five
low islands; and nearer to the great river are three more.
The Purús is navigable for light steamers 1648 miles five
months in the year; for 800 miles its depth is not less than
45 feet. The lands are subject to inundation, the river at
times rising 50 feet.</p>

<p><b>The Juruá</b> is a similar river, navigable for 1133 miles.</p>

<p><b>The Javary</b>, the boundary line between Brazil and Peru,
is navigable for craft 260 miles. The region is occupied by
savages.</p>

<p><b>The Trombetes.</b> On the north side of the Amazon there
are fewer important rivers, the Trombetes, the first from the
east, which is navigable 135 miles, comes from the Guiana
Highlands.</p>

<p><b>The Negro</b>, 900 miles from Pará, 1500 miles long, is
navigable for 450 miles forming midway a succession of
lagoons, and overflowing its banks, often for a width of 20
miles. The rivers farther west have been sufficiently described.</p>

<p>The average depth of the Amazon is 50 feet, the current
is three miles an hour. Beginning to rise in November the
river is fullest in June, then falling to November. The
Madeira, which rises and falls two months earlier, is in
places 4-6 miles wide. The width of the Amazon is 20-60
miles, while in periods of inundation the forest is partly
submerged for a width of 400 miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Plata Basin</span></h4>

<p>A much smaller portion of Brazil lies in the basin of La
Plata; this, at least for the moment, is the best and richest
part of the entire country, containing the greatest population
outside of the coastal fringe.</p>

<p><b>The Uruguay.</b> At the south the several rivers forming
the Uruguay, which rise in the Serra do Mar, drain Rio
Grande do Sul and part of Santa Catharina, while from there
up to the north end of São Paulo and into Goyaz only a narrow
coast region is outside the Paraná Basin.</p>

<p><b>The Paraná.</b> The most remote source of the Paraná,
that of the branch Paranahyba, is in the Serra Pyreneos in
Goyaz, while the Rio Grande branch rises in the Serra da
Mantiqueira near the peak Itatiaiá, so to say, in sight of Rio.
Many affluents are received from the States of São Paulo
and Paraná, these generally flowing northwest or west; the
Paraná itself flows southwest forming the western boundary
of those States. A branch, the Tiété, in São Paulo, 700
miles long, is broken by 54 rapids and two falls. The
Paranapanema in Paraná, 600 miles long, is navigable for
30 miles. The Iguassú, rising in the Serra do Mar in Santa
Catharina and flowing west is hardly navigable for canoes.</p>

<p>Twenty-eight miles above the mouth of the Tiété the
course of the Paraná is interrupted by the Falls of Urubupungá.
From here to the Guaira or Sete Quedas Falls, 400
miles, there is unobstructed navigation. At this point the
river forms a lake 4¹⁄₂ miles long and 2¹⁄₂ wide before cutting
through the Serra de Maracajú. Then after rushing
through a deep and narrow gorge for two miles, it plunges
down a long cañon hardly 200 feet wide in a series of rapids
or falls called the Sete Quedas, Seven Falls. It is reported
as able to supply over a million horse power, probably the
most of any cataract in the world. Again the river is navigable
from a little below the falls, and with regular service
it forms an outlet for the State of Paraná to the ocean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span></p>

<p><b>The Paraguay.</b> The River Paraguay rises near Diamantino
in Matto Grosso receiving a number of tributaries
from that State, one of which, the Cuyabá, called the São
Lourenço lower down, has its source close to that of the
Tapajós branch of the Amazon.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Coast Rivers and Lakes</span></h4>

<p><b>Other rivers</b> flow directly into the Atlantic, several of
some importance. North of the Amazon a few small rivers
are called auriferous, the Araguary of considerable length.
South of the Amazon Delta, some rivers flow north and
northeast among the mountain ridges, others directly to the
ocean. Of the former the most important are the Parnahyba,
900 miles long, navigable in sections, and farther south
the São Francisco, the largest river of the coastal region,
navigable 192 miles from the coast to the fine Paulo Affonso
Falls, and above these for a much greater distance. The
Jequitinhonha, 500 miles long, has 84 miles navigable. The
most important river south of the São Francisco is the Parahyba
do Sul, 658 miles long, rising in the State of São Paulo
and flowing across Rio. It is navigable from its mouth a
distance of 57 miles and 90 in its upper course.</p>

<p><b>The Ribeira de Iguapé.</b> The only coast river of economic
importance south of Cape Frio is the Ribeira de
Iguapé which rises on the table-land of Paraná and after
receiving several affluents breaks through the mountains
near the boundary of São Paulo. Besides a navigable channel
of 118 miles it communicates with an inland waterway
called the Iguapé or Mar Pequeno, extending many miles
along the coast. In Rio Grande do Sul, where the coastal
plain extends half across the State, several rivers partly
navigable flow into the important Lagôa dos Patos, with
which is connected by a navigable channel, 61 miles long,
the Lagôa Mirím.</p>

<p><b>Lakes.</b> The Lakes of Brazil are few in comparison with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
the rivers. Those in the Amazon Basin are reservoirs from
the overflow of the rivers and rise and fall with these. The
coastal section has lagoons and inland channels formed by
uplifted beaches; they are usually shallow and some, as in
Bahia, are associated with swamps; but on the Alagôas
coast the lakes are long, narrow, and deep. The largest
coastal lakes are the two in Rio Grande do Sul already
mentioned, separated by broad sand beaches from the ocean,
with which they communicate by a channel 42 miles long
at the south end of the Lagôa dos Patos. This lake is 140
miles long and 30 wide; the Mirím is 78 miles long and at
the most 25 wide. Both are navigable, though shallow and
with many sand bars.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Climate</span></h4>

<p>This great country of Brazil presents considerable diversity
of climate, as already observed. The forest covered
Amazon Basin is hot, with slight variation throughout the
year, and with heavy rainfalls; but while the average temperature
is over 80°, ranging from 65° to 95°, some locations
are decidedly preferable to others. The regular rainy
season is from November to March, a second of less degree
from August to October; also the rainy season is said to
last nine months. On the upper Amazon there is a short
dry season in January and February. There is a flood time
November, December, and higher water from March to
June. The average rainfall is about 78 inches, the rise of
the river 45 feet. There are east winds, warm and moisture
laden, the deflected trades, and colder winds from the west
and southwest.</p>

<p>The coast region as far south as Santos is generally
warm and humid (except for a stretch at the northeast),
with a wet and dry season, though it rains also in the latter,
except on the arid northeast coast. A variation occurs in
Pernambuco where it rains from March to August, the dry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
and cooler season in Rio. Here on the edge of the tropics
the annual temperature is 5° lower than on the Amazon.
At Santos rainfall is heavy and the place is hot, but farther
south it is cooler with a wider range of temperature and a
more even distribution of rain. In Rio Grande do Sul the
mercury ranges from 20° to 80°. Cold southwest storms
from the Argentine pampa, occasionally as far as Rio, create
discomfort for two or three days at a time. The highest
temperature in Rio is 98.7°.</p>

<p>The Brazilian plateau is very different. As a rule the
days are hotter and the nights cooler, the air drier, than on
the coast at the same latitude. With mean temperature 68°
there is occasional frost. Brazilian Guiana is hot and arid,
though with more rain at the east and west than in the
centre. South of the Amazon from Piauhy to southern
Bahia is another semi-arid section with a rainless season
from June to December, when streams are dry and fields
are burned bare. With heavy rains from January to May,
the country is covered with verdure; when these fail, sometimes
for successive years, the droughts are destructive to
agriculture and cattle. The plateaus of Minas, São Paulo,
and Rio have a climate which is modified by luxuriant vegetation,
south winds, and their altitude; though Minas
Geraes, having forests only along the rivers and at the
south, is hotter by day, but with always cool nights. The
open lands of São Paulo also have higher daily temperature;
the annual mean is 68°-77°. In south Minas and São
Paulo frosts occasionally occur. In the State of Rio there
is a delightful climate in the high valleys of the Serra do
Mar, temperature 45°-90°. The table-lands farther south,
Paraná, Santa Catharina, and Rio Grande do Sul enjoy a
temperate climate with abundant rain, occasional frost, but
no snow. The northern valleys of the Paraná River are sub-tropical,
the mean annual temperature of Goyaz City
being 77°.</p>

<p>The country over a large extent may be considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span>
healthful; the yellow fever which once afflicted Rio and some
other cities has been exterminated by rigid sanitary measures,
and the conditions of life on the eastern plateau and
in the temperate south are agreeable. The Amazon Valley
is of course malarial, though some sections are far better
than others. It would seem that the lower parts which
are subject to inundation can hardly be made suitable for
residence whatever precautions are taken; but the higher
lands may be to some extent free of malarial poison, and
certain parts have a climate which some Europeans, even
Englishmen enjoy.</p>

CITIES</span></h3>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Capital</span></h4>

<p><b>Rio de Janeiro</b>, the capital of Brazil, with a population
of 1,200,000, the second city in South America and the fifth
in the Western Hemisphere, is generally conceded to have
the finest harbor in the world. It is also the most beautiful
city in respect to natural advantages, while the improvements
which have recently been carried out have made the
artificial structure of the city in harmony with its picturesque
surroundings. In the early part of this century the
Government awoke to the disadvantages of the narrow
streets, the poor facilities for commerce, and the notoriously
bad conditions of health. Immense improvements were inaugurated
and speedily executed. Fine drainage canals
were installed, mosquitoes practically exterminated, wide
avenues were cut through dense quarters, and port works
constructed, so that in health, beauty, and commercial convenience,
nothing remains to be desired. A new Central
Avenue, now renamed Rio Branco, is counted among the
finest in the world; other splendid avenues are lined with
fine commercial structures or beautiful private residences,
perhaps with royal palms; along the shores are magnificent
boulevards unrivaled in beauty, often thronged with luxurious
automobiles, all amid surroundings of ideal loveliness
of sea-shore and of mountain. Hotel accommodations,
hitherto only fair, and inadequate, are improving with the
erection of needed new structures, as increasing travel for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>
business and pleasure demanded. Living expenses are
called high in all parts of Brazil, but on the whole Rio
has seemed no dearer than New York. The city may boast
of a splendid opera house, said to have cost $5,000,000, of
the largest library in South America, and the finest art gallery,
a wonderful botanical garden, museums, delightful sea
and mountain resorts, etc., etc.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">States and Cities</span></h4>

<p>As the country of Brazil is so large and of such diversity
in its various sections and even in single States, with many
independent systems of railways connected with its numerous
harbors, it may be desirable to speak of its ports and
to some extent of its railways in connection with a review
of the different States. In this we may begin with the
Coastal States, coming up from the south, and conclude
with those of the interior.</p>

<p><b>Rio Grande do Sul</b>, eleventh in area among the States
of Brazil, and equal in size to Indiana and Illinois together,
borders on Uruguay at the south. The Uruguay River
separates it from Argentina on the west and most of the
way from the State of Santa Catharina on the north. Its
population is about the same as that of the State of South
Carolina, which is one-third of its size. It is called a pastoral
State as its chief source of wealth at present is cattle;
45 of the 70 million acres are cattle ranges, 6¹⁄₄ million,
farms, and 13³⁄₄ forests. The nearly 9,000,000 head of cattle
are called the best in Brazil. Blooded stock is being introduced
and packing houses are taking the place of <i>saladeros</i> for
<i>charque</i> or dried meat, which formerly were the destination
of most of the cattle. High class poultry is extensively and
profitably raised, $4,500,000 being invested in the industry.</p>

<p>With a temperate climate and well watered, the country
is by no means confined to stock raising, for its agricultural
products are more diverse than those of any other state.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span>
Not only cereals like wheat and oats, but cotton, rice, sugar
cane, tobacco, <i>manioc</i>, alfalfa, etc., even tea are successfully
raised, as well as temperate zone fruits and vegetables. It
has important coal mines, with some of copper, gold, and
wolfram also being operated, and a wide distribution of
these and other minerals. With 13,000 industrial establishments
its important factories include nine textile mills.</p>

<p>The capital, Porto Alegre, is the chief manufacturing
centre, and the State is third in such industries. The capital
is the largest city in southern Brazil, with a cosmopolitan
population one fourth of German descent. An important
commercial and industrial centre, it has fine public buildings,
colleges, theatres, clubs, good shops, parks, and hotels.
The population is nearly all white with a large percentage
of Italians as well as of Germans.</p>

<p>Rio Grande is the chief port, 1000 miles south of Rio de
Janeiro, and 180 by sea north of Montevideo. The city lies
just inside the entrance of the Lagôa dos Patos at its south
end. Unfortunately, the entrance has been obstructed by a
sand bar with a varying depth of water above. Vessels
drawing more than 11 feet could not pass; uncertainty, often
a few days’ waiting was the fate of others. An attempt to
dredge a passage was unsuccessful, but with building of
jetties improvement is manifest. Port works in the city,
including a mile of quays, have been established, and a rapid
development of the region is expected to follow. The city,
population 40,000, has an active commerce by rail and water.
By rail it is connected at Cacequy with the through line from
São Paulo to Montevideo, and beyond this line at Uruguayana
(population 20,000), on the Uruguay River, with the
Argentine railways on the other side. There is regular
steam navigation to the port of Pelotas, three hours, population
32,000, noted for its dried meat products, and to Porto
Alegre at the north end of the lagoon, 150 miles and 12
hours distant.</p>

<p><b>Santa Catharina</b>, north of Rio Grande, less than one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
third of its size, has rather similar characteristics. Bordering
on the Atlantic, it has Argentina on the west; on the
north is the State of Paraná, from which it is separated
for half the distance by the Iguassú River. The State is
notable for wheat growing and other grains, for cattle and
dairy products, for its exports of fruits, for its coal mines,
and for the timber from its forests, especially the Paraná
pines. It ranks second in Brazil as a producer of <i>yerba mate</i>,
in Portuguese <i>herva matte</i>, 14,000,000 pounds being its annual
output. Its manufacturing establishments (174) are of small
size.</p>

<p>The capital and chief port is Florianopolis on an island
of that name. Improvements in the way of good port works
are in hand, and though without rail connection a tonnage
of about 300,000 has entered and cleared in a year. The
port of São Francisco, a smaller town in the State, is called
the best port south of Santos. This advantage will give the
city future importance. Already it has rail connection by
way of the town Rio Negro with Curityba and Paranaguá,
and so with Ponta Grossa on the São Paulo-Uruguay Railway
which of course crosses the State, a distance of 225
miles. The city is expected to be the terminus of a road
which will pass through União da Victoria to the Iguassú
Falls and across Paraguay to Asunción.</p>

<p><b>Paraná</b>, about the size of Rio Grande, is between Santa
Catharina and São Paulo, having Argentina also on its
southwest corner beyond the Iguassú River and its great
Falls. Along the western border flows the larger river,
the Alto Paraná (with the tremendous La Guayra Falls)
separating the State from Paraguay, and farther north from
Matto Grosso. Besides these boundary rivers the Paranapanema,
affluent of the Paraná, flows between this State and
São Paulo, while the Rio Negro and Iguassú are between
it and Santa Catharina. Many more tributaries of the
Paraná are entirely within the State. <i>Matte</i> is the chief industry
at present, 100,000,000 pounds being annually exported;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
but with the best wheat land of Brazil, its forests of Paraná
pine, and other varieties of timber it may have another leader
before long. Paranaguá, the State’s chief port, with a deep
anchorage and improvements planned, is now visited by 650
vessels a year and has a total annual trade of $6,000,000. A
smaller port, Antonina, is on the north side of the same bay.</p>

<p>The capital, Curityba, has rail connection with the two
ports and with Ponta Grossa on the line to Uruguay traversing
these three States. In the delightful four hours’ journey
of 70 miles from Paranaguá to the capital, the climb of the
Serra do Mar up a steep tropical valley is made without cogs
or cables by means of high trestles, bridges, and 17 tunnels;
the ride rivaling if not surpassing in beauty the more famous
one from Santos to São Paulo.</p>

<p><b>São Paulo</b>, a great and justly famous State, about the
size of Arizona, more than twice that of New York, has
Minas Geraes on the north, also east with a small extent of
the State of Rio de Janeiro; the ocean is southeast, Paraná
south, and Matto Grosso west. This enterprising State
is the leader in agriculture, producing 60 per cent of the
world’s coffee supply, besides cotton, sugar, tobacco, cereals,
etc., in large quantities; it is second to Rio in manufacturing
industries, contains large mineral riches, is advanced in
stock raising, leads in educational advantages, and has the
best railway service of 4300 miles. The wealth of this State
is estimated as at $1,100,000,000 in agriculture, $500,000,000
in manufactures, $170,000,000 in railways, and $2,230,000,000
miscellaneous. While most of it is in the torrid zone, the
altitude of the State averaging over 2000 feet gives it (except
for the narrow coastal strip) a fine healthful climate, a
blessing enjoyed too by the States previously mentioned.
In the Falls of its rivers the State possesses 3,000,000 horse
power of which only 250,000 is employed.</p>

<p>The port of Santos, population 80,000, is regularly visited
by the large Transatlantic and North American steamers.
It is called one of the best and most important ports of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
world, receiving 1600 ships annually besides coasting vessels.
The largest ocean steamers, 20-40 foot draft, come
up to the quay which extends for three miles along the
harbor front; fine granite walls rise five feet above high
water mark on a base 10-20 feet thick. Modern machinery
is provided, making it the best equipped port in Brazil, and
nothing is allowed to interfere with the efficiency of the
service. It is a very busy city though warm. The heat
does not prevent people from rushing about. A Brazilian
writer has said, “People do not run, they fly.” The reason
for this unusual haste, by no means manifest in Rio, is that
many prominent business men come daily, others occasionally,
from São Paulo by morning train, returning at four
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> A splendid railway which will be referred to later, leads
to that important city, a two hours’ ride.</p>

<p>The capital city, São Paulo, 310 miles from Rio and 50
from Santos, while lacking the charm of Rio’s scenic beauty,
is preferred by many as a place of residence on account of
its cooler climate, the greater business activity apparent,
and the cosmopolitan society, more than one third of the
population being of foreign birth and another one third
direct descendants of Europeans. The city has many splendid
buildings, both public and private, including an opera
house superior to any in the United States, a large number
of excellent schools of various kinds, and all the attractions
and facilities, except good and adequate hotels, of a city of
half a million inhabitants.</p>

<p><b>The Federal District of Brazil</b>, the capital, Rio de
Janeiro, has been sufficiently described except as a port
city. From a commercial point of view the harbor and port
works are the chief interest. The Guanabara Bay is a wonderful
harbor, not merely on account of its size, depth of
water, absolutely safe anchorage, and the beauty of its surroundings,
but it is extraordinary from the fact that it is
hardly a mile from the ocean to the landing docks. Here
a granite quay extends for 2¹⁄₄ miles along the water front<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>
with a depth of water alongside of 31 feet. The deep
channel entrance is narrowed to a mile in width by long
narrow peninsulas extending on either side and further by
a small island blocking the waves. The docks have the
additional protection of a projecting point of the city, on
the other side of which, on rare occasions, the waves do
break over upon the splendid boulevard. The larger inner
harbor is hardly noticeable, being cut off by peninsulas and
islands, of which last the bay contains nearly a hundred.
The entire bay is 18 miles long, and the inner section is
15 miles wide. At the docks the most modern machinery
is provided for hoisting, loading and unloading ships, with
electric power for the work and for lighting. A width of
80 feet was left for railway tracks; back of these are storage
ware-houses, administration offices, and customs, for which
a space of 110 feet was allowed. Behind these buildings is
an avenue 125 feet wide, with double tracks on which run
electric cars. Two million dollars are now (1921) to be
expended for additional port works, an extension of the
granite quay or dock wall about 2000 feet and two breakwaters
of 800,000 cubic feet.</p>

<p><b>Rio de Janeiro.</b> This State, though containing or surrounding
the capital, is distinct from it, with a capital of
its own on the opposite shore of the bay. As the direction
of the coast line changes here, the State has the ocean east
and south; São Paulo is west, Minas Geraes north, and
Espirito Santo at the northeast. The State is comparatively
small, being only about one sixth the size of its western
neighbor, and less than one twelfth of its northern; it is
even a trifle smaller than Espirito Santo, its next coastal
neighbor.</p>

<p>Nictheroy, the capital, is a comparatively small, quiet
town of 65,000 population, which has some important manufactories.
The State has other smaller towns, as Petropolis,
the so-called summer capital, population 30,000, at an
elevation of 3000 feet. The Parahyba Rio do Sul, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>
flows northeast, back of the mountain range, is navigable
to the city of Campos, population 30,000, 60 miles from its
mouth. The agricultural products are important, the State
ranking third in coffee and second in sugar. Large quantities
of corn and rice are raised, the coast lands with lakes
and lagoons being well suited to the latter. Valuable
forests and minerals exist, and in manufacturing industries
of great variety the State stands first. Besides the harbor
of Rio there are a number of good though small ports.</p>

<p><b>Espirito Santo.</b> Little Espirito Santo, northeast of Rio
State, has Minas at the west and Bahia north. The principal
products of the State are coffee, rice, and other cereals,
sugar, cotton, and <i>mandioca</i>; while the export of fine timber,
rosewood, satin and brazil wood, is increasing. Gold and
precious stones are its chief minerals. Its factories are few,
but the town of Itaperim on a navigable river has cheap
electric power, which makes it a fine centre for industry
in the future.</p>

<p>The capital and chief city, Victoria, population 20,000,
is the first port of importance north of Rio. On a fine bay
2¹⁄₂ miles wide with a narrow entrance of less than ¹⁄₂ a
mile, it is the outlet of the eastern part of the State of
Minas, which contains the richest mineral deposits so far
exploited in Brazil. A railway connects the port with interior
cities. Works of importance have been planned, a
quay ⁵⁄₈ of a mile long with 28 feet of water and with suitable
equipment; the widening and deepening of the channel
entrance, and the building of a steel bridge to the main land
from the island on which the city stands. Over 500 steamers
and 200 sailing vessels clear yearly.</p>

<p><b>Bahia</b>, an important and well known State, the largest
yet considered, exceeding California in area, touches three
smaller States on the north, Piauhy, Pernambuco, and
Sergipe; it has Espirito Santo and Minas on the south and
Goyaz west. All kinds of tropical and subtropical products
are found here, cacao, sugar, and coffee in large quantities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>
rubber of the <i>maniçoba</i> and <i>mangabeira</i> varieties, cotton,
vanilla, the finest kind of oranges and pine apples, and other
fruits. Bahia has the principal whale fisheries of the country
and the best grounds for table fish. Its mineral wealth includes
even the sand, <i>monazite</i>, the most important supply in the
world.</p>

<p>The capital and chief port, 720 miles northeast of Rio,
about 60 hours sail, is generally called by the name of the
State, though its proper title is São Salvador. It has an excellent
and beautiful harbor, though over-shadowed by the more
remarkable picturesqueness of Rio. The bay, Bahia de Todos
os Santos, about 25 miles wide (three at the entrance), and
20 miles deep, provides good anchorage for large steamers, 40
feet close in shore. It is a port of call for Trans-Atlantic
liners and for steamers from North America, the only one
north of Rio for some of the Lines. A company has undertaken
port works which will greatly advance the prosperity
of City and State, the works to include three breakwaters and
two quay walls, the levelling of a large wharf space, erection
of store-houses, laying railway lines, installing electric cranes,
and constructing a floating dock and a lighthouse. Over 1000
large steamers with 2,300,000 tonnage enter the port annually.
The imports are $13,000,000, the exports $20,000,000. The city
is connected by rail with various cities in the interior of the
State, and with the São Francisco River at a point above the
Falls, from which there is navigation upstream a distance of
990 miles. The river has a length in the State of 850 miles.
Bahia is a great cocoa port, shipping about one-fifth of the
world’s supply; the State produces about as much tobacco as
Cuba.</p>

<p><b>Sergipe</b>, the smallest of all the States, is larger than nine
of ours, a trifle bigger than Maryland and Delaware together.
The São Francisco River separates it from Alagôas on the
north, it has Bahia on the west and south. Its chief products
are cotton, sugar, and rice; the cattle industry is important;
the State has profitable manufacturing industries; cotton mills,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>
sugar, shoes, soap, and other factories, and unworked mineral
deposits.</p>

<p>The capital, Aracajú, population 40,000, is a small port
with 95,000 tons of shipping yearly; but it suffers the disadvantage
of receiving ships of no more than 8 feet draft, and
needs the improvements now planned.</p>

<p><b>Alagôas</b>, of triangular shape, has Sergipe on one side
and Pernambuco on the other, the ocean on the third. Its
main products are sugar and cotton; the cattle industry is
prosperous; it has copper, lead and iron deposits, not
operated, and very important milling industries, particularly
of cotton. The São Francisco River is regularly
navigated 175 miles to the Paulo Affonso Falls, around
which there is a railway 52 miles long to navigation above.</p>

<p>The capital, Maceió, is a modern city; its suburb, the
port, Jaraguá, with a tonnage of 600,000. The State is the
most thickly populated next to Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p><b>Pernambuco</b>, the twelfth State in size, with area equal
to that of New York, extends well into the interior, though
with a coast line of 112 miles only. Ceará and Parahyba
are on the north, Alagôas and Bahia on the south, and
Piauhy on the west. The State leads in the production of
cotton and sugar, sometimes exporting 150,000 tons of the
latter, and raw cotton worth $5,000,000. Other agricultural
products are secondary, but cattle and dairying are important,
still more the milling industry. Minerals, coal, iron,
saltpetre, kaolin, and manganese exist in paying quantities.
There are two good ports besides the capital; railways connect
Recife with Maceió and with cities inland.</p>

<p>Recife (often called Pernambuco), capital of the State,
is a port protected by a coral reef parallel to the shore,
where fine works are being constructed: these include a
breakwater three-fourths of a mile long, a stone jetty one-half
a mile; quays, one with 33 feet of water, one with
28-30, together three-fourths of a mile long, also other equipment.
One thousand steamers are its annual quota, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span>
tonnage of 1,750,000; the city has obviously great commercial
importance, exporting especially cotton and sugar, also rum,
hides, and cereals. Its imports surpass those of any other
Brazilian city except Rio. The cost of living is high.</p>

<p><b>Parahyba</b> has on the north Rio Grande do Norte, Pernambuco
south, Ceará west, and 72 miles of coast east.
Cotton is the chief product, and mandioca is important.
Vast coconut groves of trees, growing wild, should be taken
advantage of. The pastoral industry is important, with
goats a specialty as with its neighbors.</p>

<p>A little below the capital, Parahyba, at the mouth of
the Rio Parahyba do Norte, is the seaport Cabedello, where
port works are planned.</p>

<p><b>Rio Grande do Norte</b> is the first of several States which
have the Atlantic Ocean on the north. It is on the east
also, forming a coast line of 290 miles. Parahyba is south
and Ceará west. Here, too, cotton and sugar are the chief
products, though 180 tons of rubber annually, from the
<i>maniçoba</i> trees, are of value; the cattle and goats are important;
<i>carnaüba</i> wax and vegetable oils come from the forests;
the State, from natural <i>salines</i>, supplies much of the salt used
in Brazil. Dried and salt fish are supplied to the rest of the
northern States, and much cotton cloth and thread are exported.
Natal, the capital, is near the mouth of the Rio
Grande. A great reservoir with a dam 160 feet high and a
capacity of 2,200,000,000 cubic metres of water is to be constructed,
the irrigation of 250,000 acres thereby transforming
a large district; others here and in Ceará.</p>

<p><b>Ceará</b>, smaller than Pernambuco, is nearly twice the
size of Rio Grande do Norte, which with Parahyba is on
the east; Pernambuco is south and Piauhy west. Cotton
is the chief product though coffee, sugar, cacao and cereals
are also raised. Cultivated rubber is exported as from
Bahia; the cattle industry is important, though affected by
occasional severe droughts. However there are approximately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span>
2,000,000 head of cattle. Minerals and precious
stones are found in variety.</p>

<p>The capital and port, Fortaleza, is one of the worst on
the coast. Three powerful dredges are maintained by the
Government for the continual dredging of the channel into
which sand from the dunes is ever drifting. Two smaller
ports require similar dredging.</p>

<p><b>Piauhy</b>, eighth of the States in size, with a deep interior
has the smallest coast line, only 43 miles. It has Ceará
and Pernambuco east, Bahia south, and Maranhão west,
from which it is separated by the Parnahyba River. The
State has the expected agricultural products, vast herds
of cattle and large flocks of goats; important forest wealth
of rubber, timber, wax, and medicinal plants, and a variety
of minerals. It has one seaport, Amarraçao, but a good deal
goes out from a port of the next State, Tutoya, on the other
side of the river Parnahyba. Therezina, the capital, is
of some importance.</p>

<p><b>Maranhão</b>, a little larger, has Piauhy east and south,
Goyaz south and west, almost touching Bahia between
these two; it has Pará also on the west. Its coast line is
100 miles more than Piauhy’s. Cotton is the chief agricultural
product, but others exist; the cattle industry is important,
much live stock going to Amazonas; there is good
forest wealth, various minerals, and important cotton factories.</p>

<p>São Luis do Maranhão, the capital, population 50,000, is
called the chief port though troubled by sand, while Tutoya
is excellent.</p>

<p><b>Pará</b>, a name at last familiar to all, is third of the States
in area, equal to Texas and California, with West Virginia
thrown in. It has Guiana on the north, with the Atlantic
northeast; east are Maranhão and Goyaz. Matto Grosso is
south, and Amazonas west. Its chief products are of the
forest, particularly rubber, also Brazil nuts, medicinal
plants, oils and timber. Little is done in agriculture though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
many plants grow freely such as cotton, rice, tobacco, and
especially cacao, of which 3500 tons a year have been exported.
There are large herds of cattle, perhaps 2,000,000
head, and various minerals are found. One railway, with
branches, leads from Pará to Bragança, near the ocean,
and to other towns; and one is open for a short distance in
the valley of the Tocantins, the beginning of an ambitious
project.</p>

<p>The capital, Belém, usually called by foreigners Pará
is a fine city of 200,000 and the only considerable seaport,
if so it may be termed, as it is on a bay of the Pará River
80 miles from the ocean. Mean temperature 78°. Harbor
works, begun in 1906, and costing over $60,000,000, have
been of immense value. They include a fine quay a mile
and a half long with a depth of water part of the way of
30 feet, docks and storehouses, two floating docks, a Custom
House, oil storage tanks, etc. One thousand steamers
formerly entered yearly with tonnage of 1,500,000; imports
at one time were valued at $15,000,000 and exports at $30,000,000.
A channel from the outer river, 30 feet in depth,
is marked by 26 buoys lighted by acetylene gas. The city
is notable with attractive plazas, a unique forest park, a
museum, a white marble theatre, and a good hotel. The
various cities or villages are coast or river ports, some on
the Amazon, others on the Tapajós, Xingú, Tocantins,
Araguary, or smaller streams.</p>

<p><b>Amazonas</b>, first of the inland States, and the largest of
all, has Colombia and Venezuela north, Pará east, Matto
Grosso, Bolivia, and Acre south, and Peru and Colombia
west. Its area is equal to that of our three Pacific Coast
States with Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Colorado. In this
great space the population, estimated at 435,000, is about
one person to 1¹⁄₂ square miles. Manaos, the capital, and the
various other centres of population by the river side mean
rubber. There are no roads except of water, no paths save
those made by rubber gatherers, with a few by Indians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
the number of whom is a mere guess. All tropical products
thrive but their production is negligible save that of rubber.
Various minerals are unexploited. Manaos, 924 miles from
Pará, 1030 from the ocean, and 2000 from Rio, is the first
real city in the wilderness, though Obidos, still in the State
of Pará, is a port where 300 vessels call in a year, and a
number of smaller places claim that title.</p>

<p>Manaos, a city of 60,000 population, is located just off the
Amazon seven miles up the Rio Negro, on a large quiet
bay. Port works have been constructed, a fine stone wall
over 1500 feet long, with floating docks to fit the 50-foot
rise and fall of the river, and 16 electrically equipped warehouses
conveniently arranged. Considering its location, it
is a wonderful city, well lighted, with a splendid opera
house, expensive of course, a fine cathedral, schools, a
public library, museum, and good sanitation. One thousand
four hundred miles farther is the Peruvian city of Iquitos,
near the limit of navigation for ocean vessels on the main
stream. Some distance below Manaos the Amazon is
entered by the Madeira River which gives access to the
State of Matto Grosso and to Bolivia.</p>

<p><b>Matto Grosso</b> is second in size, equal to the States mentioned
above without Nevada and Colorado. Estimated
population 275,000. This State has Amazonas and Pará
on the north, Goyaz, Minas Geraes, São Paulo, and Paraná
on the east, Paraguay and Bolivia are on the south,
and Paraguay and Bolivia west. The State is much more
open than Amazonas; its chief industry is cattle. Forest
products however abound, with all kinds of rubber and
magnificent timber. There are large agricultural possibilities
and considerable <i>matte</i> is exported. Diamonds and
auriferous sands are exploited though their origin is uncertain.
The river systems north and south meet in the highlands,
and connection might be made by a short canal,
opening a way from Pará or Manaos to Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>Cuyabá, the capital, on a river of the same name, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
affluent of the Paraguay, is quite a city, population 32,000,
although 1045 miles above Asunción, while Corumbá, lower
down, on the Paraguay, is of nearly equal size. The river
at Corumbá is 1000 feet wide, and 6 feet deep at the docks
at low water. Corumbá is regularly visited by steamers,
though 1800 miles by river from Montevideo. Its export
and import trade amounts to at least $4,000,000 annually.</p>

<p><b>Goyaz</b>, the fourth State in size, following Pará, has
Maranhão on the north, Maranhão, Bahia, and Minas Geraes
are on the east, Minas and Matto Grosso are south, and
Matto Grosso and Pará west. Three hundred thousand
is the estimated population with a guess at the number of
Indians of many tribes. The principal industry is stock
raising and many cattle are exported to neighboring States.
The forests have the <i>maniçoba</i> and the <i>mangabeira</i> rubber,
also a vegetable silk, <i>paina</i>. There are great mineral riches,
placer gold in many streams, and veins in the hills; many
diamonds and rock crystal are also produced. Other metals
as iron and copper exist. Navigable rivers are the means
of communication as in the neighboring States, but a railroad
is coming and more rapid development will follow.</p>

<p>The capital, Goyaz, is not much of a place, though of
late evincing progress. Several other cities have from 5000
to 10,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p><b>Minas Geraes</b>, the fourth inland State and the fifth in
size, has Bahia on the north, Bahia and Espirito Santo
east, Rio de Janeiro southeast, São Paulo southwest, and
Goyaz west, a small southwest corner about reaching Matto
Grosso below. Although without a seaport and with no
large city, Minas is the most populous of the States, with
an active industrious population. The State leads in mineral
riches of almost every kind; it is one of the foremost in
agriculture of all varieties, being second to São Paulo in
coffee; it has vast pasture lands, exporting 300,000 head of
cattle a year, a sugar refinery, flour mills, and a great
dairy industry. It has increasing railway service as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span>
river transportation. It is believed to have a mineral future
rivaling that of the best region in the world. Its factories
are important and there is a great store of water power.</p>

<p>Bello Horizonte, the present capital, was made to order
in 1897, and is well laid out with broad streets, water supply,
sewerage, everything of the best type: a Government
Palace, the finest State building of Brazil, and a fine Agricultural
School. Ouro Preto, the old capital, has a free
Mining School, said to be one of the best in the world.</p>

<p><b>The Acre Territory</b>, triangular in shape, has Amazonas
north, Bolivia south, and Peru west. It is naturally similar
to the neighboring sections. There are three Districts:
Juruá, of which the capital is Cruzeiro do Sul, population
2000, 1351 miles from Manaos; Purús, capital, Senna
Madureira, population 4000, 1320 miles from Manaos; and
Acre, capital Rio Branco, population 2000, 1351 miles from
Manaos.</p>

AND RAILWAY</span></h3>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Ocean and River Traffic</span></h4>

<p>Brazil has a considerable navy, several warships; and
a merchant marine of 450,000 gross tonnage. The leading
national line is the Brazilian Lloyd which with 62 ships
has a service to the United States as well as a coastwise,
the latter shared by the Navegaçao Costeira and other companies.
Rio de Janeiro has three dry docks, one with a
capacity for the largest battleships, and a yard where ships
are constructed. The country has 30,000 miles of navigable
rivers, with boats for these having a tonnage of 75,000.</p>

<p>Coastwise and river steamers have service in the Amazon
Basin, the most important as follows: Pará-Obidos-Manaos,
975 miles; Pará-Santarem-Itaituba (Rio Tapajós)
729 miles; Pará-Maués, Pará Tocantins, 1544 miles; Tabatinga
(Frontier) Remate dos Males, 1743 miles; Pará-Santo
Antonio (Madeira) 1617 miles; Pará-Rio, Peru-Senna-Madureira,
1934 miles; Pará-Chaves (Marajos Island),
Oyapock River; Manaos and Rio Negro to Santa Isabel,
423 miles; Manaos to the Yapurá River—to the Juruá River,
Cruzeiro do Sul, 1090 miles.</p>

<p>Other companies have service, Maranhão north to Pará,
599 miles, south to Pernambuco 884 miles; Recife north
to Maranhão 803 miles, south to Bahia 385 miles, east to
Fernando do Noronha Island, 239 miles. On the São
Francisco River, Januaria to Pirapora. Other Lines serve
from Rio de Janeiro to ports south to Laguna and Ribeira<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span>
de Iguapé, São Paulo; also on the Paraná and the Rio
Grande, and on the Lakes Patos and Mirím. Service from
Rio de Janeiro to Corumbá, 765 miles above Asunción, and
280 miles farther to Cuyabá on the Cuyabá River, in time
of high water is continued on the Paraguay 250 miles beyond
to São Luiz de Caceres.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Railway Transportation</span></h4>

<p>While the great rivers of Brazil with their 27,000 miles
of navigable waters have been a large factor in the development
of the country, of equal importance for the future is
transportation by rail. The total present mileage, second
to that of Argentina, exceeds 16,500, these having developed
from 9¹⁄₂ miles in 1854 and about 10,000, 50 years later.
About 90 per cent are of metre gauge. For the economic
unity of the great Republic, the Government policy is favorable
to a rapid extension of the present railway systems, a
matter as important as was the creation of our railways
to the Pacific 50 years ago. The development in Brazil
has been retarded by the difficult topography of the country,
in striking contrast to the Argentine plains. Along the
greater and better part of the coast is the high steep wall
of the plateau region, which must be climbed to enter the
interior. Once at the top the way in some sections is
easier, but in others there are additional mountain ranges.
The wall, obviously low in comparison with the mighty
rampart of the Andes, presents difficulties, but none to
compare with those experienced in Peru.</p>

<p>The first railway, built and operated in 1854, was from
Mauá on the north shore of the Rio harbor to Fragosa.
Soon after carried to Petropolis, it is now a part of the
Leopoldina Railway system. Only two South American
railways antedate this, the Demarara of British Guiana
and the Caldera-Copiapó in Chile.</p>

<p><b>The Central of Brazil Railway</b> was the first of much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span>
importance, its first section, 32 miles, opened in 1858. For
this road leading out of Rio expenses were heavy. Many
were the difficulties of construction, tunnels, bridges, etc.,
the boring of one tunnel, only 1¹⁄₂ miles long, requiring
seven years. The system, now in Government ownership,
has a network of lines extending from Rio to the city of
São Paulo, to Bello Horizonte in Minas, and to other points.
It has express trains with sleeping cars (state rooms), and
a heavy suburban traffic. It is intended to carry this
system northward to the city of Pará, with branches to new
territory. Twenty-five million passengers are carried
annually with much freight of coffee, lumber, iron, manganese,
etc. The railway is to be electrified near the capital
with a Government appropriation of $32,760,000.</p>

<p><b>The São Paulo Railway.</b> The most successful, financially
and otherwise, of the railways of Brazil is no doubt
the São Paulo, operating a double track, broad gauge line
(5 feet 6 inches) from Santos to the town and junction,
Jundiahy (population 20,000), 86 miles; it passes through
the city, São Paulo, and has a branch to Bragança, 65
miles. This road has a granted monopoly of trade between
the two cities, Santos and São Paulo, 50 miles apart. This,
in spite of the great expense of the railway construction,
has insured them large profits, dividends in 1912-13 being
14 per cent. The train mile earnings are the largest in
South America and normally are greater than any reported
in the United States. With the construction of more and
more lines in this State and beyond, a steady increase in
the traffic seems assured, as nearly all must pass in and out
by way of Santos. The road now carries annually more
than half of the world’s coffee supply.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="009" style="max-width: 75em;">
  <img class="w100 p2" src="images/009.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">ENVIRONS OF SÃO PAULO AND RIO DE JANEIRO</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One of many engineering triumphs in South America,
the railway is ranked among the greater achievements of
the world. An ascent of 2600 feet is made within seven
miles. Beginning 15 feet above the sea not far from Santos
five inclined planes with 8 per cent grade, each 1¹⁄₂ miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>
long, serve for the rapid climb. A stationary engine at the
top of each plane runs the cables; to grip these a small
engine is attached to each car. The tracks seem unique.
The double track on the inclines has but three rails for up
and down cars, which therefore cannot meet there, but may
on the intermediate levels of which there are four, each
600 feet long. On each side between the middle and the
outside rails are the pulleys which carry the cable, an endless
steel wire of enormous strength run by a 1000 horse
power engine, capable of carrying six freight or three passenger
cars at the same time. In this short section are 16
viaducts, 15 tunnels, and two miles of retaining wall. One
viaduct is 334 feet long, and nearly 150 feet high in the
centre. There are now two of these double roads, one just
above the other, as I have seen, and not on a different route
as stated elsewhere. The first soon proving insufficient to
accommodate the freight, the second was built with a few
technical improvements. It is a wonderful ride through
tropical forests, with scenes of picturesque beauty.</p>

<p><b>The Sorocabana Railway</b>, 864 miles, which traverses a
rich and progressive part of Brazil opening up new territory,
has important connections with other lines. This Company
has several lines running west and northwest from São
Paulo. One of the most important is to Baurú, a city also
on the Paulista Railway. From this point the North Western
Railway has continued the line to Itapura on the Paraná
River and across the State of Matto Grosso to Porto
Esperança on the Paraguay, about 40 miles by land from
Corumbá on the west side of the River, and 80 by water.
Probably a train-car ferry will later be provided at Esperança
and the road continued on the other side to Corumbá.
By the present road connection is made with Bolivia
opposite, and by water with Paraguay farther down, the
capital Asunción being about 700 miles distant, Montevideo
nearly 1800. Previously to the completion of this railway
Corumbá and that section of Brazil was reached from Rio<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>
only by a long, long sail, three weeks (farther than to
Europe) by steamers of the Brazilian Lloyd Line. After
making calls along the Brazilian coast, at Montevideo and
Buenos Aires, these boats continue up the Paraná and
Paraguay Rivers, arriving at last once more in their own
country. This new railway and others now in construction
will be an immense factor in opening the great central
table-land of Brazil, with its rich possibilities for agriculture,
cattle raising, and mining.</p>

<p><b>The São Paulo-Rio Grande</b>, another important railway,
853 miles, runs from São Paulo to Sant’ Anna do Livramento
on the border of Uruguay, where it connects with the Central
Uruguay Railway to Montevideo. Improvements have
been made so that with better connections and sleeping cars
to the border, which were lacking part of the way in 1916,
the journey is now made in comfort in 4¹⁄₂ days to Montevideo.
The road runs through a rich, often beautiful
country; in some places with splendid scenery and fine
forests, in others with open grazing lands where good cattle
are visible, past small towns and pleasant rivers. People
who are willing to work could find agreeable homes in this
section with excellent temperate climate. Low land values
are spoken of, which if genuine should make this an attractive
region now that fairly good transportation exists with
more in prospect. This line has several branches of its
own, while other railways are connected with the through
line, local roads to ports or to interior towns. One of these,
the Paraná Railway, has its main line from the port Paranaguá
to the State capital, Curityba, and to Ponta Grossa
on the São Paulo-Rio Grande; it has north and south
branches, the latter to Rio Negro and to São Francisco.</p>

<p>The southern part of the São Paulo-Rio Grande Line
belonged to the Compagnie Aux Chemins de Fer de Brasil
which had a concession for the entire State of Rio Grande.
Roads from Porto Alegre and from the city of Rio Grande
extend to the line from São Paulo, thus making connection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>
with Montevideo and Buenos Aires. From the Cacequy
junction a line goes west to Uruguayana on the Uruguay
River. Along this river the Brazil Great Southern operates
in Rio Grande 110 miles from Quarahim on the Uruguay
border through Uruguayana north to Itaqui, with an extension
to São Borja 77 miles farther up. At Quarahim an
international bridge 700 yards long connects the Brazil
and Uruguay Railways. Across the Uruguay River connection
is made from Uruguayana with Argentine Railways,
and a direct route to Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>There are other roads in the São Paulo, which
has the best system in Brazil and the most mileage: over
4000.</p>

<p><b>The Paulista Railway</b>, extending northwest from
Jundiahy through rich coffee territory with Barretos a
recent terminal, has many branches and a mileage of 721.</p>

<p><b>The Mogyana</b> goes much farther north, crossing a corner
of Minas and entering the State of Goyaz, on the way to
the capital city of that name. It has arrived at Santa Cruz,
still quite a distance from Goyaz, though with a total mileage
of 1081.</p>

<p><b>The Southern São Paulo Railway</b> runs along or near the
coast 100 miles from Santos to Juquiá.</p>

<p><b>The Leopoldina.</b> An important British line or system
nearly 2000 miles in length is the Leopoldina, the main line
extending from Nictheroy, on the bay shore opposite Rio,
to Friburgo, Campos, Victoria, Leopoldina, and other points
in the States of Rio, Minas, and Espirito Santo. Lines run
also from Rio and Mauá up the mountain to Petropolis and
beyond, connecting with the main line. This follows the
Parahyba Valley for some distance and then crosses four
mountain ranges, a work involving many unusual feats of
engineering. On the main line the maximum grade is 8
per cent, on the Petropolis section 15 per cent. The territory
traversed is highly productive, and in spite of expensive
construction good returns in normal times are assured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span></p>

<p><b>The Great Western.</b> Under British control is the Great
Western Railway which has Pernambuco as its centre.
Lines extend north along the coast and also to the interior
with 1000 mileage in the several states of Pernambuco,
Alagôas, Parahyba and Rio Grande do Norte. It reaches
the ports of Maceió, Parahyba, Cabedello and Natal. Two
and a half million passengers were carried in one year and
much freight.</p>

<p>In the state of Bahia short lines run back to the interior,
one, 140 miles, from Nazareth, south of the bay, and one
from São Felix, 165 miles, to Santo Amaro, serving the best
sugar district, as Nazareth that of cacao and manganese
ores. The principal road is from Bahia, 281 miles, to
Joazeiro, on the São Francisco River; the oldest, opened in
1860, is along the coast to Aracajú in Sergipe, 268 miles.
Two other small railways are farther south, in all about
950 miles.</p>

<p><b>The Brazil North East Railway</b> operates in Ceará about
472 miles, one division from the port of Forteleza, another
from the port Camocím to Granja and Crato.</p>

<p>The State of Pará has less mileage than most of the
others, the short line, 40 miles built, at the junction of the
Tocantins and Araguaya to avoid bad cascades. Another
road, the Bragança, runs northeast from Pará to the Atlantic
Coast.</p>

<p><b>The Madeira-Mamoré</b> is in some respects the most
remarkable railway in Brazil, perhaps in the world. It was
built in accordance with a treaty with Bolivia in settlement
of the Acre difficulty, and in compensation for the surrender
by that country of the Acre Territory, to give access to
that Republic by making a way around the prohibitive falls
and rapids on the Madeira and the Mamoré Rivers. In the
heart of the wilderness, 570 miles up the Madeira River
and about 1100 miles from the sea, this road, 202 miles long,
was constructed. In 1871 an American, Colonel George
Earl Church, a Civil War veteran, and a distinguished civil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span>
engineer, turned the first sod of the railway, but work was
soon suspended. In 1877 P. T. Collins of Philadelphia
undertook the task and completed 20 miles of railway, but
the difficulties were too great, especially the mortality,
modern methods of sanitation not then being understood;
the work was therefore abandoned. In 1907 the recent
operations were begun, again in charge of Americans, and
the road was opened for traffic, July 15, 1912. From Porto
Velho the road runs up the river to Guajará-Mirím, the
road of course on the Brazilian side of the river, and in the
State of Matto Grosso, which is thus made accessible as well
as Bolivia. The new little American town of Porto Velho
of 1500 population has an ice plant making six tons a day,
a wireless telegraph to Manaos and other conveniences. The
road passes through a jungle which is cut out 100 feet wide.
Two days are required for the short journey. At Abuná
they halt for the night; leaving early next morning they
should arrive at the terminus at 3:15. About 60 miles south
of Abuná, Villa Murtinho is passed, opposite the town of
Villa Bella in Bolivia, at the junction of the Beni and the
Mamoré, which two rivers form the Madeira. A road across
from Villa Church opposite Guajará-Mirím or from Villa
Bella to Riberalta on the Beni was in the plan, as the Beni
below Riberalta is unnavigable on account of rapids.
Automobile roads are now in construction, at least one from
Riberalta to Puerto Bello (Villa Bella) or to Villa Church.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLIX">CHAPTER XLIX<br><span class="small">BRAZIL: RESOURCES AND INDUSTRIES</span></h3>
</div>


<p>Brazilian industries as we have already seen have the
variety befitting a country of its enormous area. The States
of Minas, Pernambuco, and São Paulo can produce almost
anything, but even these have specialties. Of the various
products of Brazil, as in the other South American countries
except Bolivia, the vegetable are the most important, with
coffee far in the lead. Stock raising comes next; minerals
of prodigious variety and richness are third. Manufactures,
developing later, may in time largely satisfy the requirements
of the inhabitants.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Agriculture</span></h4>

<p><b>Coffee</b>, we all know, is in value the most important crop
of the country, growing over vast areas, chiefly in what we
may call the northern part of South Brazil, the States on
or near the edge of the tropics, São Paulo, Rio, Minas, and
Espirito Santo. North and south of these States coffee
grows and flourishes more or less according to local conditions.
There are said to be 1,400,000,000 coffee trees in
Brazil, which produce perhaps three-fourths of the world
supply, more than half of them in the State of São Paulo.
The State contains about 60,000 plantations. Probably
more than 1¹⁄₂ billions are invested in the industry, $900,000,000
in São Paulo. The larger part of the crop moves
over the wonderful railway between São Paulo and Santos
and goes out from that port, some from adjoining States as
well as from São Paulo. For ten years the average value of
the coffee exported was $120,000,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span></p>

<p>Great fortunes were made by some who embarked many
years ago in the business; the coffee king, Colonel Schmidt,
who has 8,000,000 trees and produces 11,000 or 12,000 tons of
coffee yearly, was himself a poor immigrant. But the best
lands were taken up long since; production is increasing in
other countries, as well as consumption, and there is not
now the opportunity of earlier days. São Paulo especially
has the rich red soil that the plant loves, the sloping ground,
the right climate, and the water supply, over a greater
extent of accessible territory, probably, than any other land
in the world; though districts in other countries produce
coffee of equal excellence. Here of course there are different
varieties and grades, the original plants having been
imported from Arabia and Java and preserving their characteristics.
Life on the <i>faezendas</i>, as the farms are called,
is agreeable both for the rich proprietor and for the Italian
and other laborer, who has his own garden and whose wife
and children help in the picking season. The rows of trees
extend for miles in even lines; there are great cement drying
grounds in the sun, pulping machinery, and store-houses.
The business generally is in the hands of Brazilians,
though there are foreign stock companies, paying large
dividends. Coffee is about 40 per cent of the Brazil exports
and 97 per cent of São Paulo’s.</p>

<p><b>Cacao.</b> Other agricultural industries are of importance
and capable of infinite expansion. Cacao is a product the
consumption of which is rapidly increasing. Bahia stands
second in production, a crop of 40,000 tons being exported
from the city in 1917. Cacao forms 60 per cent of the State’s
export. Large areas of suitable land are said to be available
for plantations in States south of the Amazon, including
North São Paulo and Matto Grosso. That grown in
Maranhão ranks as the best. The groves run inland along
the river valleys, full of rich red soil. There are two gathering
seasons, one from September to April, the next crop
beginning in May, less important. It is said that one person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span>
can take care of 1000 trees, which yield from 5 to 13, sometimes
20 pounds annually. A plantation at pre-war prices
cost 80-85 cents a tree. Three hundred are planted to an
acre. The investment of a moderate sum is pretty sure to
give good returns after three or four years.</p>

<p><b>Sugar</b> plantations are increasing and sugar is exported
in considerable quantities. This was one of Brazil’s earliest
industries, but languished on the discovery of gold in the
17th century, to be followed by several revivals. The
amount exported varies, in 1909 it was 70,000 tons, in 1916,
54,000. It is cultivated near the coast and inland, chiefly
from Rio Grande do Norte south to São Paulo, though it
is also raised down to Rio Grande do Sul, where the 1916
crop was worth $3,000,000. In one year 441,000 tons were
produced, 109,000 exported. The yield in some States farther
north is 20 tons to the acre. In general little fertilizing
is done and crop rotation is not followed, so that lands have
become degenerate after centuries. The most flourishing
seats of the industry are in Rio, and in Pernambuco, 1000
miles north. In Rio, Campos is the focus. The State has
31 large sugar mills, Pernambuco has 46. São Paulo is
third, other States have fewer, but small mills are scattered
everywhere making brown sugar and <i>cachaca</i>, native rum.
In the large mills the best machinery is used, and it is said
that 300,000 tons is the total output. The export is to Uruguay,
Argentina, Great Britain, United States, and Portugal. Almost
every cotton, coffee, or other <i>faezenda</i> grows its own sugar.
Eighty or ninety pounds a head are used. Cane ripens in the
northern States in about 15 months; south of Rio in 18-20
months.</p>

<p><b>Tobacco</b> was in use in Brazil in prehistoric days. The
State of Bahia is the centre of the largest production, though
it is raised in almost every State. The quality varies in
different localities, but in some it is said to be equal to the
best Havana, especially in Bahia, where the soil is similar.
Forty-five thousand tons were exported in 1902, chiefly to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>
Germany; in 1916, 2100 tons, valued at over $7,000,000.
A plantation of 37 acres earns $10,000 a year.</p>

<p><b>The Coconut</b> is another product, which might be more
important. It is found near the coast from Parahyba to
Bahia, 1,250,000 trees bearing 50,000,000 nuts, the size of
which compares well with others. One hundred million
trees are also reported. At present there is practically no
export, but large possibilities exist for an important industry.
There are three shipping ports, Cabedello, Maceió,
and Recife, three-fourths of the trees near the first two. On
the plantation the nuts sell for $25-$35 per 1000, according
to size, and in cities at $42.50. No attempt is made to produce
copra, as the natives are fond of the milk and fruit.
With New York price $160 a ton for copra and $10 freight
it is better to sell the nuts at home, but if business were
done on a large scale, good profit would result. Improper
spacing injures production; of two groves, one 75 trees
to the acre and one close by, 130 trees, the yield of the
first is four times that of the second. Labor is cheap,
disease and pests unknown. The by-products are valuable;
fibre for cord or rope, the husk for fuel, the milk for breakfast,
and palm leaves for building or for hats. To develop
2000 acres of land a capital of $30,000 is estimated as necessary,
giving a net return for the first seven years which
would average $31,865 a year, 105 per cent on the capital,
with gross receipts for the last year of $300,000. If the
profits are half the estimate the investment would seem a
good one.</p>

<p><b>Other Nuts.</b> The Brazil nut is an equally well known
edible, mostly exported from Pará; in 1914 over $2,000,000
worth. The trees are large, often 150 feet high. <i>Babassú</i>
nuts are exported, some thousands of tons, chiefly from
Bahia, yielding a high percentage of oil, similar to that
from the coconut. Also the <i>souari</i> or butternut brings a good
price and has commercial possibilities, having a larger percentage
of fat than other known species. Its cultivation is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span>
believed to be more profitable than that of coconuts. Tagua
nuts are exported in small quantities.</p>

<p><b>Cotton</b> is an important product likely to have a large
increase, though a diminishing amount is exported, $8,000,000
worth in 1914 and $500,000 in 1916. This does not indicate
lessening production but large increase in cotton milling.
Cotton of long silky staple of high merit here grows wild or
with careless cultivation. Growing in almost all parts of the
country, it is best on the northeast promontory and along the
coast to the Amazon. There is little culture, not yet ¹⁄₂ million
bales, where 20 might be produced. United States cotton
buyers in 1916 were astonished to find here the long silky
fibre. One of the best varieties is similar to the Peruvian, a
hardy, prolific perennial growing 13 feet high and yielding
for at least three years. One tree was bearing after 16 years.
Maranhão has raised this kind for centuries. It has the high
percentage of 38 to the boll and is similar to that cultivated
by the Incas. Under the names Moco, Serido, and Sede de
Ceará, this cotton is grown in these north States. <i>Gossipium
microcarpum</i>, related to <i>peruvianum</i>, is said to produce a
pound of clean cotton from 120 bolls. These varieties have
fuzz on the seeds, but four other varieties have clean seeds,
the most important, the <i>Gossipium vitifolium</i> found wild in
Brazil, still producing long silky staple. Sea Island and the
best Egyptian belong to this stock. These varieties can be
cultivated here without fear of rival anywhere, and offer a
fine field for the investor. In the State of Pernambuco cotton
production is more important than sugar. Much is produced
in São Paulo. Export growers, and good roads or railways
are needed to stimulate production.</p>

<p><b>Cereals</b> are obviously of far less importance in Brazil
than in Argentina, yet many tons are produced and the possibilities
are large. Rio Grande do Sul alone produces wheat
in quantity, though not enough for her own needs; Santa
Catharina, São Paulo, the hills of Rio and Minas are suitable
for cereals, and wheat, barley, oats, and a little rye are seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span>
in the south near European colonies. The chief cereal grown
is maize; in patches it is found everywhere, and in enormous
fields in the centre of Brazil. With <i>mandioca</i> it is the food of
the common people, in spite of the large consumption of
flour in the cities.</p>

<p><b>Fruits.</b> The fine fruits of Brazil deserve greater exploitation.
I have eaten really delicious pineapples in Rio
only. There may be as good elsewhere, there cannot be
better. The oranges of Bahia have an equal reputation.
It is from that State that the navels were introduced into
Florida. If superior to the California fruit as were the old
Floridas, it is time they were more extensively cultivated
and exported to the United States.</p>

<p>Rice is growing in importance. Formerly imported, its
production has increased until now there is an export
balance.</p>

<p>Beans are raised and consumed in great quantities;
recently some have been exported.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Forestry</span></h4>

<p>It is well known that the forest country of Brazil has an
enormous area. The entire rubber region is estimated by a
Brazilian authority as covering 1,000,000 square miles, half
of which is in Brazil. Other forest regions of a different
character are on the highlands and at the south, all together
covering 1¹⁄₂ million square miles. The forests contain the
varieties that might naturally be expected with others peculiar
to the country, medicinal plants, trees with gums and resins,
woods hard and soft, but mainly hard; some ornamental,
others useful as timber; plants supplying tannin, quebracho
and others; the beautiful Araucanian (Paraná) pine, the
candelabra tree, of which there are 800,000,000 in Paraná.
The wood is said to be 20 per cent stronger than the pine of
Sweden; the trees are nearly 200 feet high, with a diameter at
the base of ten feet. Other figures are 100 feet tall and three
feet in diameter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</span></p>

<p>The timber industry is of slight development, but Paraná
and Santa Catharina afford much good building material. The
Brazil Company has in the two States over 500,000 acres with
5,000,000,000 feet of good standing timber and three mills.
One of these, at Tres Barros, located on a railway, has a capacity
of 40,000,000 feet a year, with planing mill, box factory,
etc. There is a great market in Brazil and Argentina. Among
unusually valuable trees is the <i>peroba</i>, with a trunk weighing
30 tons, worth $7 a ton on the spot. The <i>imbuya</i> tree which
resembles mahogany is heavier than water. An infinite variety
is found with infinite uses.</p>

<p><b>Rubber</b> still has some importance, in spite of the great
diminution of export owing to the development of the Ceylon
plantations. Once the price was $3 a pound; in June, 1921, 15¹⁄₂
cents. Unfortunately the industry in past years was very
badly conducted, with short-sighted policy, wasteful methods
in tapping trees, foolish importation at excessive cost of all
kinds of supplies including food, far too high prices to the
laborers; partly in consequence of extortion and cruelty, a
scarcity of labor; in addition, high export duties. The idea
prevailed that people could get rubber nowhere else and must
pay whatever price was asked. It was a severe shock when
Ceylon rubber came more and more into the market, and was
found to be a formidable rival. Although not generally considered
equal to <i>Pará fina</i>, the Ceylon answers for most purposes.</p>

<p>The Government is now lending aid to the industry, encouraging
plantations, and better methods otherwise. The
export tax at Pará has been slightly lowered but is now 24¹⁄₂
per cent. A Government investigation, however, in 1912-14
at a cost of $47,000,000 did little besides paying fat salaries
to favored individuals. The Ceylon export has recently been
300,000 tons to Brazil’s 37,000. So far synthetic rubber with
the special therapeutic base has cost four times the <i>hevea</i>.
The <i>Pará fina</i> is of course the <i>hevea brasiliensis</i>, which constitutes
the larger part exported from the Amazon, 80 per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>
cent of a good workman’s product. <i>Sernamby</i> is a by-product
of scraps or careless work, though even the better is liable
to be contaminated more or less with leaves, nails, etc. <i>Caucho</i>
from the <i>castilloa elastica</i> is not so good, and in procuring it
the tree is usually destroyed, as previously stated. Near the
mouth of the Amazon where some collectors are quite independent,
owning their own homes on the edge of the forest,
are white rubber trees producing <i>fraca</i> or weak rubber; not
so good as the <i>hevea</i> which has the most resilience, and is
tough and elastic. For many purposes these qualities are
essential, hence the higher price. Red rubber coagulates badly.</p>

<p>Men from the State of Ceará, especially in times of drought,
have been glad to go to the Amazon as rubber collectors;
and half wild Indians of Peru and Bolivia have been employed.
The rubber is collected in the dry season, June to November.
Dr. Oswaldo Cruz, a famous Brazilian physician, said of
some of the Amazon regions that there were no natives, as
all the children die; others declare that the normal condition
of older persons is to be afflicted with malaria, beriberi, dysentery,
pneumonia. Still others maintain that much of the higher
land is fairly healthful for persons of careful habits who have
good food. Conditions are improving. American and other
companies are organizing on a more scientific basis than formerly,
and with humane plans which in the long run will prove
profitable. Lands have been secured in desirable locations
where men can live all the year, raise their own vegetables,
and not be dependent for their entire living, aside from fish,
on canned stuff at enormous prices. To put Amazon rubber
on a better basis it is necessary that the output be cleaner,
the expenses of the collector smaller, and his living better
through local cultivation of fruit and vegetables, which here
grow luxuriantly, and with better habitations on suitable sites,
so attracting a better labor supply. A further reduction by
the Brazilian States of the rubber export tax, now about 24
per cent in Pará, seems also desirable.</p>

<p>Besides the <i>hevea</i> and <i>caucho</i>, two other varieties of rubber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</span>
are exported, the <i>maniçoba</i> and the <i>mangabeira</i>, which have
a place, like the balatá of the Guianas and Venezuela and
the Guayule shrub from Mexico. The first is from the
<i>manihot</i> tree which grows up to 4000 feet altitude, on a rocky
soil where there is not too much rain; it is good for many
purposes. The <i>mangabeira</i>, mostly from Pernambuco, grows
on a sandy soil at 3000-5000 feet, but is a wet rubber not
highly valued.</p>

<p>The Ceylon rubber trees, the seeds of which were taken
from the Amazon and germinated in Kew Gardens, first blossomed
in 1881. The seeds were used to plant more trees. In
1900 four tons of rubber came from the East, in 1910, 800
tons; the output in 1916 was about 150,000 tons. One million,
three hundred thousand acres are now producing in Ceylon,
India, Borneo, and elsewhere, a monument to British enterprise.</p>

<p><b>Herva Matte.</b> A very important export, rather forestal
than agricultural is called in Portuguese <i>herva matte</i>, the
<i>yerba mate</i> of Spanish. Paraná is its special home where it
grows wild in the forests, straying over into the neighboring
States of Matto Grosso, São Paulo, Santa Catharina, and
Rio Grande do Sul, and being native as we have seen to
Paraguay, and to Misiones in Argentina. The trees or shrubs
often grow in sections with the tall Paraná pines, the tree
with the candelabra top, which is not only an ornament to
the landscape but supplies good lumber, and pine kernels as
large as chestnuts. These when boiled make a nutritious
food, much relished by the Italians. The chief export of
<i>matte</i> is through the city of Paranaguá, after preparation in
the mills of the region. In 1915, 75,800 tons were exported,
largely to Argentina, some also to Europe; 40,000 tons is an
average amount. It is much used by the residents of Paraná,
but in most of Brazil coffee has the preference.</p>

<p><b>Fibres.</b> Besides cotton Brazil produces fibres of excellence
from a variety of plants. A wonderful article but little
known to the general public is the remarkable <i>paina</i>, called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span>
in Europe <i>kapok</i>, 34 times as light as water, 14 times, as
cork. Chiefly produced in the Orient, it is obviously excellent
for life preservers, also for mattresses, pillows, and for whatever
needs to be light, warm, elastic, and impermeable. The
best fibre, best packed, comes from Java, inferior grades from
India and Africa. Introduced into Venezuela, it was so packed
with stones and refuse that it was rejected when sent to
Europe, although the article was of fine quality. Careless
exporters of all articles should take warning. Other good
fibres of Brazil are <i>aramin</i>, from which coffee bags are made;
<i>pita</i>, from which the Amazon Indians make hammocks woven
with much art, and sometimes with feathers interspersed along
the edge. Palms and aloes supply other fibres, some equal,
they say, to the famous <i>henequen</i> (<i>sisal</i>) of Yucatan. Banana
fibre is used by north lace makers for a curious stiff shiny
lace, some quite beautiful, fine and intricate, and some with
a darned-in pattern of heavier silk thread, on a filmy background.</p>

<p><b>Carnaüba Wax</b>, which forms an under coating of the
leaves of the <i>carnaüba</i> palm, is not unlike beeswax. Nearly
600 tons were exported in 1915 valued at $2,400,000. The
trees grow in the north States, especially in Rio Grande do
Norte, where there are 15,000,000 trees, and in Ceará. Large
amounts of the product are used locally. The wax is of
excellent quality, melting at a low temperature and burning
with a bright light. Mixed with a little beeswax and 10 per
cent fat, it is easily worked and makes candles of high quality.
It is much used for shoe blacking.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_L">CHAPTER L<br><span class="small">BRAZIL: OTHER INDUSTRIES</span></h3>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Cattle Industry</span></h4>

<p>A leading industry of Brazil which, it has been said, may
even in São Paulo supersede in importance that of coffee is
live stock. Two packing houses now slaughter 300,000 cattle
per year, one Brazilian, at Barretos, the other an American,
the Continental Products, at Osasco near São Paulo, exporting
chiefly to France and Italy. Another American Company
has at São Paulo a plant that will handle daily 1500 head of
cattle, 1000 hogs, and 2500 sheep. In tributary territory,
which would include parts of Matto Grosso and Minas, 2,500,000
cattle are estimated. It is said that the best breeding
ground is Matto Grosso, where the cattle run wild as once in
Texas, though each rancher has a certain range and his cattle
are branded. The Brazil Land and Cattle Company procured
8,000,000 acres in Matto Grosso, Paraná, and Minas, mostly
well watered and with good grazing, except in Matto Grosso.
Much fencing was done and buildings were erected. Recent
increase in prices has improved prospects. This property is
now owned by the Continental Products Company, in which
the Wilson packers are interested.</p>

<p>Other vast lands are available. From the ranges of Matto
Grosso the cattle are driven across to fattening pastures of
southwest Minas and northwest São Paulo where the land
has been planted to grass, though it is said that a native grass,
<i>caipim gordura</i>, grows there all the year round. Argentina’s
alfalfa lands make the cost of fattening an animal six months
$7.50, while with <i>caipim gordura</i> in Brazil $1.33 covers the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span>
expense. Some Brazil grasses are of the highest class while
others are good only for goats. On the Araguaya River the
grass is 16-17 feet high. The Jaragua is over 3 feet. In
Amazonas and Pará cattle are said to flourish but not goats
or pigs. Rio Grande near the Uruguay line has fine grazing
lands; those in Minas and São Paulo at an elevation of 1200-1400
feet where animals never need shelter are excellent.</p>

<p>Before the packing houses were started jerked beef only
was marketed from the herds, hence, as thin cattle were preferred
for that purpose, there was no object in improving
the grade. Now there is systematic progress. Breeding farms
are operated, fine stock has been imported, and in time high
grade meat, perhaps equal to the Argentine, will be marketed.
Twelve thousand tons were sent to Europe and the United
States in six months in 1916, though the first experimental
1¹⁄₂ tons was sent in November, 1914. At the School of Agriculture,
Piracicaba, São Paulo, are good imported bulls, and
one of native type, the Caracú, with pale buff hide, fitted to
be the base of standardized herds. It seems that in some
sections, notably Matto Grosso, a cross with the Indian
zebu, which has a hump, and its descendants, is best qualified
to resist the climate and the insect pests of that region;
but in the pastures of Paraná and Rio Grande, Herefords,
Durhams, Jerseys, etc., will flourish. The zebu is of large
size and its skin is excellent leather, but packers say the
hump does not pack well, and the shoulder is thin. Plants
now or soon to be in operation south of São Paulo are three:
in Rio Grande, one of Swift, one at Pelotas, Brazilian, and
one at Sant’ Anna of Armour. The President of Paraná
has been extending high roads towards Guarapuava to tap
the State of Matto Grosso, and a large drove of cattle has
come down. He desires to have an American packing house
established in the State and will arrange with a suitable
company to make no advance on the export tax for 15
years. Paranaguá, a port which we have already noted,
is well served by the Brazilian Lloyd Line and the Funch-Edye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span>
from New York. Similar concessions are offered in
Santa Catharina, which State has lower export duties; and
by the Governor of Rio Grande, who would exempt from
all export taxes any foreign company; though a tax of
10 milreis, $3.33, is imposed for every cow slaughtered, to
protect the herds from decimation. If all the herds number
30,000,000, 2,500,000 or more might be slaughtered yearly
without diminution. Cattle formerly were killed for their
hides only, and the export of these is still important; 37,000
tons exported in 1915 were valued at $13,000,000.</p>

<p><b>Sheep</b> raising seems inappropriate for a tropical climate,
but in Rio Grande do Sul development is possible, also on
the highlands of São Paulo, Minas, and Matto Grosso.
Experiments with Romney Marsh have been successful for
both wool and meat. Now there are 11,000,000 sheep,
7,000,000 goats, 18,000,000 hogs, 6,000,000 horses, and
3,000,000 mules and donkeys in the country.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Manufactures</span></h4>

<p>While Brazil may not be called a manufacturing country,
she had over 26,000 such plants in 1916; and her statesmen
are eager to increase these industries, for which her immense
water power gives her unusual advantages. The largest
concern in this field has a capital of $8,000,000 and an
annual output worth $4,500,000; it employs 2800 hands making
sacking, yarn, rope, thread, etc., this in São Paulo. In
the textile field, the cotton mills naturally lead with over
200 mills and an investment of $80,000,000. They exist in
various States, employing 80,000 persons; one in Pernambuco
near the city of Olinda is a sample. The estate of
45 square miles of pasture and woodland borders on the
sea, the shore fringed with coconut trees. Machinery and
some technical workers were brought from England. All
the processes of making fine cloth are there followed; they
spin, dye, weave, color, and print. Native dyes are used in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</span>
part. Of 3500 hands employed 70 per cent are women and
children. Over $35,000 a month are paid in wages. Dwellings
are rented at low prices or owned by employes; schools,
hospital, and dispensary are free. A dairy and a stock farm
belong to the estate, brick factories, a bakery, etc. A lumber
yard is important. One thousand tons of coal a month are
usually consumed, but in war time wood was used. The
cotton is bought, $200,000 a month, and as much a year is
spent for chemicals, drugs, etc. From 960 looms 1,500,000
metres of cloth 22-26 inches wide are produced a month,
from blue denim to fine flowered fabrics; the products are
sold in 80 stores owned by the Company in various States.
Brazil has 11 flour mills of commercial importance, located
in the States of Rio, São Paulo, Paraná, and Rio Grande do
Sul, at one time having no tax on wheat, but ten cents a
kilo on flour, by means of which the infant industry was
started. In 1915, 800,000 barrels of flour were imported
from the United States and 600,000 from Argentina, a little
from Uruguay; at the same time enough wheat was imported
and milled to make 2,750,000 barrels, evidence of
the work of the mills. For metal working there are 134
shops for imported iron. Factories exist of almost every
kind. Leather goods are produced especially shoes for
which there are many factories; hats, clothing and a variety
of ordinary articles, such as soap, hosiery, brooms, paper,
wagons, etc. Brazil workmen are skilful and the industries
are certain to increase.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Mining</span></h4>

<p>The mining industry of Brazil, if not precisely in embryo,
for it has been in a very flourishing condition, is now in a
state of prospect; on the verge of a great development
rather than of active operation, except for a few varieties of
metals. At the moment there is little working except in
gold, diamonds, monazite, manganese, and coal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span></p>

<p><b>Manganese</b> has recently been the chief mineral exported
on account of war necessities, 245,000 tons valued at 7
million dollars, in the first half of 1917, in contrast to 85,000
tons in the same part of 1914. The mines are in Minas,
Matto Grosso, Bahia, and elsewhere, those in Minas being
accessible to the port of Rio. In Matto Grosso, 18 miles
from Corumbá, there is a deposit called the Urucum, estimated
at 30,000,000 tons of undeveloped ore; one, the
Quelez, in Minas of 5,000,000, 30 miles from Rio, and
others. The ore averages over 50 per cent of metallic
manganese, with a little iron silicate and phosphorus.
Americans are interested in the works as the metal is valuable
in the iron and steel industry. With better transportation
facilities for these and other deposits, a good future is
certain.</p>

<p><b>Gold</b> mining was naturally the first to be developed.
Minas has been the chief producer. Of Minas Geraes the
writer Diaz said, “In this State what does not hide gold
contains iron; what does not contain coal spreads diamonds.”
After the discovery of gold in 1693, 80,000 men
toiled for a century at placer mining for the King of Portugal.
About $1,000,000,000 has been taken out. The Morro
Velho, said to be the oldest producing mine in the world, is
now with the Ouro Preto worked by British Companies.
The first is being worked at the depth of a mile with no sign
of exhaustion. The gross receipts for the year ending
February 28, 1917, were over $4,000,000, the profits $750,000,
from a tonnage crushed of 187,400. The Ouro Preto Company
operates the Passagem Mine five miles from the former
capital of that name, being the first to use a stamp mill in
1819. The average thickness of the lode was ten feet, now
about eight. Gold properties exist in many States, the most
important around three mountain chains, the Mantiqueira
and Espinhaço, which cross Minas and Bahia, running into
Pernambuco; the range between Minas and Bahia, and
Goyaz, continuing into Piauhy and Ceará, west of the São<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span>
Francisco River; the third east of the Paraguay and
Araguaya Rivers. Those most worked are in the Espinhaco
Range in Minas and Bahia. Dredging has been carried on
with varying success, but some of the companies have been
overcapitalized. An American Company has recently acquired
some old concessions of land in Goyaz, rich in gold and
diamonds, where extensive operations are expected shortly.</p>

<p><b>Diamonds.</b> As for diamonds, since the first stone was
discovered in 1721, many precious gems have been produced.
During 40 years in that century $17,500,000 worth were
exported. The city, Diamantina, 500 miles from Rio, is
the centre of one of the most important fields. Gems are
found in pot-holes, one of which contained 10 pounds of
diamonds and 28 of gold. Others are in clay deposits in
rocks of sandstone and schist. In the River Bagagem near
the border of São Paulo, 250 miles from Diamantina, three
great diamonds have been found: the Estrella do Sul, in
1853, weighing 254 carats uncut, was sold to the Gaekwar
of Baroda for $400,000, the others weighing 117 and 175
carats. Other fields are in Paraná, Bahia, Goyaz, Matto
Grosso, and São Paulo, in Goyaz on the Garças River, tributary
to the Araguaya. Apparently most of the stones are
now smuggled. They are said to be finer than the Cape
diamonds and also to be sold for them. Black diamonds
are found, of great value in the arts, and many precious
and semi-precious stones, such as amethysts, tourmaline,
topaz, etc., in various places.</p>

<p><b>Copper</b> exists in several States, but production is slight.
A mass weighing over 2600 pounds was discovered years
ago near the city of Bahia, and there are six well known
districts in the State. In Rio Grande do Sul an extensive
property was opened which showed 6.5 per cent copper
and 30 grams gold per ton. Minas will probably rank
next to these States. Promising quantities are near Campos
in Rio de Janeiro; there are also ores in Goyaz, Paraná,
Matto Grosso, Parahyba, Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span>
Maranhão; some are hardly accessible. One of those in
Bahia covers nearly 15,000 acres, about 30 miles from the
railway. Belgians and Dutch have operated at Camaquam,
Rio Grande do Sul.</p>

<p><b>Iron</b> in actual mountains occurs in Minas, 12 billion
tons of the highest grade in 52 outcroppings. Deposits
have been acquired by American, British, German, and
French interests. The manager of a British company which
owned 90,000 acres said, “One could travel 23 miles one
way and 16 another on outcrops of ore, <i>canga</i>, or rubble.”
In one deposit 30,000,000 tons are in sight, 60 per cent
pure.</p>

<p>American interests, the Itabira Company, have secured
deposits which include the celebrated iron mountain of
Itabira do Matto Dentro in the east near the head of the
Doce River. The hematite iron district is reached from
Rio by the Central and the Leopoldina Railways; but this
deposit will be tapped by a prolongation of the Victoria-Minas
Railway, now running along a part of the Doce
River. Also a branch will lead to a terminal 40 miles north
of Victoria, Santa Cruz, a small port which will be
developed and equipped with special loading machinery.
Here will be erected a steel plant with an annual capacity
of 150,000 tons of steel products, pig-iron, steel plates, rails,
etc. The iron, 326 miles from this port, runs 69 per cent
pure; some in the United States runs 52 per cent. It will
be several years before manufacture can begin. Coal will
be imported.</p>

<p>Development of iron properties has been retarded by
lack of transportation and fuel. Wagon roads are unknown.
The altitude is 2000-4000 feet and the climate good. The
coal is hardly good enough or in sufficiently large supply.
Oil development is uncertain. As there is water power
the use of electricity may be arranged.</p>

<p>Near Ipanema, São Paulo, iron is found. A large deposit
has been located in Paraná three miles from the port<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</span>
of Antonina. Other deposits in the two States south give
good promise. So far charcoal has been used for a little
smelting.</p>

<p><b>Coal</b> mining has been carried on for a long time in a
small and primitive way, but most of the coal used has been
imported. The principal deposits found are in Santa
Catharina and Rio Grande do Sul, others are in Paraná
and Pernambuco. In Paraná American interests have made
extensive purchases and expect to develop the property at
once. Rio Grande do Sul has been estimated to have 800,000,000
tons and to be able to supply 1,000,000 a year.</p>

<p>In Santa Catharina the veins are about ten feet thick;
some in Rio Grande are 4-10 feet, some 13. The property
at Xarquedas, operated for some years, produces 20,000
tons per annum. With greater activity, in March 1918,
650 tons were produced daily from two shafts, and 1000
or more was expected by the addition of a third. With
high volatile matter, good gas and salable coke are procured
for Pelotas. Coal is found in several river valleys in Santa
Catharina. State surveys are being made, and with improvement
in transport by land and water a great industry may
be developed of enormous value in promoting manufactures.
Railway construction has been authorized by the President
to aid coal companies in work, and other concessions have
been made. The briquettes from Santa Catharina coal
show hardly less caloric value than those of the Welsh
patent fuel. Much is used by the Lloyd Brasileiro and other
steamship lines including the Japanese; by railways, mills,
etc. A little is exported to Argentina and Uruguay. The
Rio Grande Railway is or was burning coal mixed with
wood on its locomotives. The best coal is 42 per cent combustible,
and when pulverized is equal to any other.
Bituminous schist sold at $12.50 a ton was used for gas
in São Paulo during the War. There are great seams
10-12 feet thick in São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul. Lignite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</span>
occurs in Pará, Amazonas, and Minas, enormous peat beds
in various places.</p>

<p><b>Monazite</b> sands exist on the Brazilian coast, probably
in larger quantities than in all the rest of the world. In
1910 Germany imported $1,000,000 worth. The thorium in
the sands, used in the manufacture of gas mantles, is extracted
in Brazilian factories before exportation. Two per
cent of thorium is in the sand, sometimes nearly 6 per cent.
It is found on the coast north of Rio and on some river banks
in Rio, Espirito Santo, Bahia, and Minas.</p>

<p><b>Graphite</b> exists in several States, especially Minas and
Bahia in rather inaccessible locations, but one deposit in
Rio is worked, for a pencil factory in the city of Rio; others
in a small way for local use.</p>

<p><b>Other Minerals.</b> Platinum is found in gold bearing quartz
and in river alluvium in Pernambuco, Minas, and Parahyba;
nickel in Minas, Santa Catharina, and Rio Grande do Sul;
salt in Rio Grande do Norte, Rio, and Minas, worked in the
last two; much is imported. Other minerals found in
various localities are asbestos, antimony and tin, bismuth,
barium, cinnabar, emery, kaolin; marble, white, rose, onyx,
and green; mica, molybdenite, saltpetre, silver and lead,
soapstone and talc, and wolfram. Among the stones
garnets, opals, pearls, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, topaz,
and tourmalines are found in more or less profusion as well
as rock crystal, useful to opticians. Minas contains almost
every variety of ore and gem, which with its good climate
and fertile soil have made it the best populated State, though
without a large city.</p>

<p><b>Petroleum</b> has been discovered in a number of States,
among them São Paulo, Minas, Alagôas, Pernambuco,
Bahia, and Sergipe; some of excellent quality in Bahia; but
whether in quantities for large exploitation is uncertain
until further investigation and work are carried on. Some
geologists believe that prospects are highly favorable. Oil
of fine quality is recently reported at Piracicaba, São Paulo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</span>
but as the petroleum is generally in schist rock its extraction
would be expensive. Recent advices state that Brazil
has 35 oil fields in four States with an area of 10,000 square
miles; in the entire country 75,000 square miles with an
estimated producing capacity within ten years of 500 to 600
million barrels.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Investments</span></h4>

<p>In view of the varied resources of Brazil, to enumerate
the possibilities for investors would be difficult. There is
hardly a line of industry which cannot there be carried on
successfully. That of coffee growing is so well developed
as to be somewhat overcrowded, but in almost any other
line there is a field for the investor. Whether it be mining
of gold or diamonds, of coal, iron, or manganese, be it agriculture,
stock raising, the lumber industry, or manufacturing,
the harnessing of the waterfalls to produce hydro-electric
power, the construction of public works, the field
for the capitalist, large or small, is of infinite variety and
excellent promise. The present Government is planning
a broad and active development of the electric power available
from its great and numerous water-falls.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_LI">CHAPTER LI<br><span class="small">SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE</span></h3>
</div>


<p>As to many it may seem presumptuous that one with
no practical experience should venture to discuss foreign
trade, I beg with an apology for my temerity to make a
slight explanation.</p>

<p>On my six trips to South America (1903-1916) I saw
and heard so much of the shortcomings of my countrymen
there, and meanwhile perceived such ignorance at home
that as early as 1907 I wrote an article on “Our Commercial
Relations with South America,” published in the <i>Van
Norden Magazine</i>, wherein I set forth many points which
prominent men of affairs have repeatedly urged upon the
attention of their fellows, even up to the eighth Annual
Trade Convention at Cleveland, May, 1921.</p>

<p>My personal observation being supplemented by extensive
reading, I venture to hope that my remarks under this
heading may be charitably viewed by those who are wiser
than I, and prove of some slight service to those whose
acquaintance with South American affairs is more limited.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In proportion to our wealth and our domestic activities
our export trade before the Great War was indeed small
in comparison to that of other nationalities. Slight interest
was taken in outside matters of any kind, even our publicists
giving little heed to foreign affairs. However, prior to
1914 there had been a slowly growing interest and a gradual
increase in our export trade, which from 1915 to 1920
showed a more rapid extension. In 1915 our exports
amounted to $3,500,000,000, in 1920 to $8,228,000,000; to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</span>
South America in round numbers, in 1915, $144,000,000, in
1920, $624,000,000, in 1921, $273,000,000.</p>

<p>As to the past and future of this matter, with especial
reference to South America, two widely divergent opinions
prevail; one, that we have accomplished wonders, and that
our trade with that continent will be permanent and, with
improvement in exchange and other conditions, increasing;
the other, that we have not done so well as we might and
ought; and that owing to our indifference, inefficiency,
ignorance, and bumptiousness, we shall be unable to retain
anything like the proportion of trade which we have enjoyed
or so much of it as might seem our reasonable share.
With some ground for each opinion, the truth as usual
lying between, there is a possibility of either result depending
upon a variety of circumstances. The first is whether
some of us acquire a willingness to learn, or persist in
certain mistaken notions and practices. Well merited
criticism of the methods of some exporters and salesmen is
far from applying to all. The “S” of a well known concern
is as familiar in South America as in North. Other great
corporations are famous the world over. Their success in
foreign sales has meant the employment of many men
abroad and of a large number at home, with the home business
supplemented and steadied by the foreign. In addition
to the extensive pre-war export of some large companies,
many small ones, whose names are less familiar, have long
sent their wares to foreign lands.</p>

<p>A matter of prime importance is that the entire nation
and people become convinced of the value, the necessity
even, of our maintaining a large export and import trade,
for we cannot have one without the other. The provincialism
of our thought and education, which have a reciprocal
influence, must be laid aside. Congressmen should be able
to feel that their reëlection will depend upon their ability
to grasp the problems confronting the whole nation, problems
of labor, transportation, commerce, finance, and world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</span>
interests, rather than upon their catering to a special class
or securing a sectional advantage. It would be well if they
were high-minded enough to act for the country’s best
interests regardless of their future fate. To demand ability
and statesmanship of their representatives in these crucial
times is the privilege and duty of the people.</p>

<p>As a nation we have prospered because of the richness
of our natural resources and the enormous extent of our
agricultural lands. The latter being now for the most part
occupied, with increasing population our welfare will depend
more largely upon the development of our manufacturing industries
and of our export trade. That the prosperity of our
manufacturing towns and seaports will be reflected in our agricultural
districts and will benefit the entire nation should be
self-evident. Supported by the people the Government will act
in accordance with its best judgment. In any case, every
one should feel that it shows a shameful lack of a sense of
duty and of patriotism to place one’s personal fortune above
the nation’s welfare in peace no less than in war.</p>

<p>For success in foreign trade as well as for safety at
home our Government must and no doubt will see that
production is not stifled for any reason, that our transportation
on land and sea, and communication by wire is unhampered
by strikes or otherwise. If need arises, previous
restrictive measures should be removed and suitable aid
granted. With abundance of shipping which we formerly
lacked, equality with European freight rates must be maintained
or competition will be impossible. The establishing
by our banks of needed branches, fortunately made practicable,
has been accomplished. The important question
of trademarks and patents may require further Governmental
consideration and diplomatic action, though some
international agreements have already been made. In certain
countries the laws have been unfair, prejudicial to the
interests of honest manufacturers and favoring the unscrupulous;
some of whom have taken advantage of the situation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</span>
to the embarrassment of legitimate American business.
Trademarks have been practically stolen, through previous
registration by foreigners without title to use them. We
must remember that the same thing has been done by
Americans in the United States, who have registered here
trademarks owned in Europe.</p>

<p>Of immense service would be a few free ports where
raw material could enter, and without paying duty be exported
either as entered or after being manufactured.
Foreign countries have fostered commerce in this way and
by allowing favorable freight rates through subsidies and
otherwise. Competition under Government ownership has
produced an enormous deficit. While better results may be
expected under private ownership, our shipping will be at
a disadvantage from difficulties imposed by the Seamen’s
Bill. It is said that American shippers may be able to pay
higher wages than European if relieved of the necessity
of employing larger crews and superfluous engineers. The
Bureaus of the Department of Commerce now perform very
valuable service: the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce,
the Bureau of Standards; also the Bureau of Markets
of the Department of Agriculture. A consistent foreign
policy, undoubtedly to be formulated and pursued by our
able Secretaries of State and Commerce, will be of great
service in relation to foreign trade and for our general
prosperity.</p>

<p>To the intelligent sympathy of the country at large and
the coöperation of the Government must be added the eager
purpose of the manufacturer, and the interest of young
men who will make of export trade their chosen field of
labor. The manufacturer who contemplates entering this
broader field or who, through peculiar war conditions, has
been brought into it without preliminary investigation,
should recognize the fact that careful intensive study is a
prerequisite for successful permanent trade, a method which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</span>
has been followed by many Europeans and by some Americans
with excellent results.</p>

<p>The book here presented it is hoped will furnish a useful
groundwork of information on South America, to be supplemented
by further study of details appropriate to the character
of the prospective exports and to any special conditions.
In these countries generally, we have observed a
great diversity in the population and disparity in their condition.
One may hope that the latter will be diminished
by advance in wages and by the education of the Indians,
by means of which their producing and their purchasing
power may be increased; but for a long time two broad
classes must be distinguished and catered to: the cultured
and literate, and the poor and illiterate laborers, especially
the Indians of the North and West Coasts. It is evident
that the requirements of a cultivated society where the
customs and dress are European in character, or of a homogeneous
middle-class population, would be quite different
from those of Indians who sleep on the floor, a whole family
in one room. A personal acquaintance with the character
of the people, their manner of life, and their methods of
business is extremely desirable. If the head of a manufacturing
industry is able himself to make “The South American
Tour” even in a hasty manner, it will be to his advantage;
if not, his export manager, if he has one, should
personally study the ground. Those who look merely for
a slight supplementary trade may best accomplish this by
arranging with a reliable commission house and following
directions. If the manufacturer decides to undertake the
matter himself, he must plan a careful campaign.</p>

<p>To make haste slowly is a good rule. Unhappily in the
past some who have attempted foreign trade have ignored
the advice and experience of others, and deemed information
quite unnecessary. With the know-it-all attitude, the idea
that business is business everywhere, and that goods and
methods successful at home must be equally good for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</span>
abroad, before the War they proceeded in such a manner
as either to make an utter failure and abandon the project,
or after large and needless losses to secure profitable business.
Criticism of two different kinds made by South Americans
should lead to the correction of faults; otherwise there
will be a complete loss of trade on the part of those who
are guilty, and much injury to our commerce generally from
the resulting bad reputation given to all Americans. One
form of criticism is directed to the character, methods, and
manners of the traveling salesman or agent, the other to the
shortcomings of the home office.</p>

<p>During the War period when at times our goods alone
were available, even poor methods and service brought results.
That the continuance of such a course will be successful
in the face of the severe competition now arising
is too much to expect. A friendly Englishman long engaged
in business in South America, in 1916 remarked that he was
<i>afraid</i> the Americans would lose 60 per cent of their business
after the War. A Peruvian the same year declared that they
would lose it <i>all</i>; so much had he been disgusted by the
arbitrary manner of some salesmen of the type who said practically,
“There is the stuff. Take it or leave it as you like.”
With a correct atmosphere in the home office and a more
careful choice of salesmen such crudeness would be avoided.</p>

<p>If the heads of the office are unable to visit the countries,
there is greater reason for wide reading. The
“Movies,” which seem to entertain many, present pictures of
a few phases of life; but it is not by such means that one
acquires the intimate knowledge of a country and people
essential for a proper conduct of trade. For agreeable and
profitable relationship of any sort with those of other
nationalities we must realize that they also have their point
of view; we need to consider how they regard us. While
we may believe our country to be the greatest and best,
and our ways and manner of living superior, we must bear
in mind that others are equally loyal to their own; though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</span>
their country may be smaller and in some respects less
advanced, its people are equally patriotic, they prefer their
own way of living and methods of business where these are
different. Many South Americans have a wider knowledge
of the world, greater culture and taste, and these in general
are more punctilious in manners and dress than the majority
of Americans. We must therefore, while preserving our
own tastes and ideals, have equal respect for theirs, cultivating
a catholicity, a breadth of view, quite different from
the spirit common among us, that everything different is
thereby inferior, that we can teach the world everything,
and that we have nothing to learn. Such an attitude is
merely a mark of ignorance and provincialism.</p>

<p>Aside from visiting the countries there are many sources
of information in regard to sales possibilities for any class
of goods. The lists of imports of the countries and of some
cities are available in commerce reports, with figures showing
the approximate quantity and ratio of these. While the
list of our exports seems to embrace almost everything, all
of the goods are not sold everywhere; a knowledge of the
various markets, of the prices at which goods are sold,
and of trade conditions is necessary, to ascertain whether
competition is possible and if there is a prospective increase
of present business. Detailed information as to many lines
of manufactures and markets may be obtained from consular
reports, from the branches of the Department of Commerce
located in a few cities, or by writing directly to the
Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce in Washington.
Many persons have written to our Consuls in Latin
America, often to their great disgust, for information, not
merely such as might be procured in Washington, but what
might be gained by looking in a geography or reading one
of many available books. The Consuls are continually
making reports with suitable information on matters which
are within their province. Membership in certain commercial
organizations gives the privilege of receiving trade information;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span>
the Philadelphia Commercial Museum, the National
Association of Manufacturers, and the American
Manufacturers Export Association, chambers of commerce,
commercial clubs, trade associations, such as one of jewelers
and silversmiths, all may be useful in this direction. The
Pan American Union through its Bulletin and otherwise
furnishes much information about Latin America. Export
Trade Journals, other magazines and newspapers, are serviceable.</p>

<p>If from investigation it appears that there is a market
for one’s goods in any section or universally, that quality
and prices can be such as to make competition favorable,
that the market can be enlarged, or should there be none
that one can be created, and a determination is therefore
formed to enter export trade, the next question is how the
goods shall be sold. The methods are various, but of only
two kinds: the direct and the indirect.</p>

<p>Direct methods include the establishing of branch
houses; the appointing of a general agent for one or more
countries or of a local agent for a limited territory; the
employment of traveling salesmen; and advertising in circulars,
newspapers, or magazines, for mail orders to be filled
by freight or parcel post. The choice of methods, and the
appointing of agents or salesmen demand the greatest care.
Exclusive rights of sale have been given for the whole continent
to a South American, incompetent even to take care
of a small district. Salesmen have been appointed from the
home office who perhaps had done well here but were
utterly unfit for work in South America.</p>

<p>It is desirable to have representatives of our own nationality.
Others if employed solely by an American Company
may do their best for it, but we now know that many
Germans, possibly others, have taken agencies for the sole
purpose of keeping the goods out of the market. A good
salesman or agent of any sort should have as his first qualification
ability to speak Spanish fluently, unless his work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</span>
is confined to Brazil, in which case of course he must speak
Portuguese. Next he should be a gentleman and <i>simpático</i>.
The spirit which led some youths in the early days in
Panamá to call the residents niggers, monkeys, and savages
is one which, though not indulged in outwardly to such a
degree, is sufficient to prevent the harmonious relations
necessary to make permanent, satisfactory business dealings.
Unquestioned integrity, unfailing courtesy, patience,
tact, straightforward action, are all highly important qualities,
as well as those essential from a strictly business point
of view, such as critical knowledge of the goods, etc. Confidence
and friendliness count more in South America than
at home. Social qualifications are desirable. It has been
said of the British that they were too cold and exclusive,
that the Germans were more friendly. On the other hand,
some Americans have felt that the South Americans did not
care for more than a business acquaintance. This is doubtless
true in many cases, but one who is cultured, sympathetic,
and well mannered is likely to have social opportunities
which he may accept to advantage.</p>

<p>Branch houses will best serve the large manufacturer,
giving a standing not otherwise attained, and best promoting
permanent relations. From these houses salesmen go to
neighboring territory. The manager must be a man of wide
experience, familiar not only with the product and home
matters, but with the language, customs, and business
methods of the country in which he is located. Some corporations
engage business houses in different sections as
local representatives or distributors, with exclusive rights
in restricted territory. Such arrangements, supplemented
by advice and literature from the home office may prove
effective in securing sales.</p>

<p>Those who cannot afford branch houses or the risk
which may attend the cost of a traveling salesman’s exclusive
service are now able through the Webb-Pomerene law
to coöperate with other houses in the same or in associated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</span>
lines of industry. Both investigation and sales may thus be
profitably conducted. Advertising only, without the employment
of other agencies, has been highly profitable to
many. It is said that advertising in South America brings
better results than in the United States. To avoid utter
waste of money careful investigation as to sales possibilities
and media should be made before planning a campaign. One
large mail order house has carried on an enormous foreign
business. Other firms have accomplished much in a similar
way. Advertising is done in journals and magazines published
here and circulated there, in local publications of
various kinds, in moving-picture houses; also by means of
mailed circulars, and to some extent by electric signs.</p>

<p>The importance of correct technical and idiomatic translation
in advertising in Spanish and Portuguese cannot be
over-estimated. Gross and ridiculous errors have been made
in the past. A book knowledge of languages seldom prepares
one adequately for such work. Foreign translators
are more numerous than formerly, but they, also, too often
make egregious blunders; not of the same character, but
caused by their not comprehending exactly the English
which they translate.</p>

<p>If indirect methods of trade are preferred as involving
less risk, trouble, and preliminary expense, and if the
medium is carefully chosen, it may be more profitable. Export
commission houses or export agents will relieve the
manufacturer of almost all care. One large commission
house not only acts as selling agent for manufacturers
through its branches in many parts of South America; it
also operates steamship lines, carries on banking and exchange,
and handles important financial transactions for
South American Republics. Certain firms of national or
worldwide reputation and large capital have for many years
been satisfied to conduct their foreign trade through such
a house. The opportunity for commission houses of this
sort was not overlooked by foreigners and one company of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</span>
these in New York did an annual business of $30,000,000
before the War.</p>

<p>The experience of a commission house is an asset, which
saves many mistakes. Their experts have a wide range of
information covering American and European competition,
and details such as suitable patterns, correct packing, etc.
The commission house may have its capital tied up for six
months in transactions, or did prior to the more general
use of the trade acceptance, while the manufacturer might
receive cash for his goods. For small people this method
of sales has many advantages, especially when first launching
into export trade. Conference and honorable coöperation
are necessary and the protection of the commission
house from direct under-selling or from other unfair dealings.
The service of export agents is preferred by some,
these acting as salesmen, forwarders, or shippers, either
for one or more concerns, perhaps on salary and commission,
or as independent agents.</p>

<p>After securing orders, by whatever means employed,
the responsibilities of the shipping department begin. The
principles governing the execution of orders would seem
to be rudimentary. One wonders how a business in this
country could achieve even a small measure of success
when violating the most elementary rules of conduct. Yet
this has been and still is done in South American trade as
recent information from various sources shows, despite the
fact that these things should go without saying, and furthermore
that they have been iterated and reiterated for
years.</p>

<p>First, the goods to fill an order should be precisely like
the sample, if there was one, not something inferior, as has
often happened, nor something just as good, or even better.
If ordered without a sample strictest attention should be
paid to prescribed details. If it is specified that cloth be
28¹⁄₂ inches wide or 25 centimetres, that is what is wanted.
If two-wheeled vehicles are ordered, what sort of business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</span>
is it that permits of sending, by mistake, four-wheeled
vehicles a distance of 5000 miles, even though the bill was
made the same and the goods were more expensive? as was
done by a well known manufacturer to his loss. The loss
to the purchaser was greater, for the vehicles sent could
not be used at all in that country.</p>

<p>The assumption that the seller knows better than the
buyer what the latter wants is offensive if true. Generally
it is not true. Mistakes are unpardonable. Requests for
particular colors, patterns, size of bolt, and character of
weave must be complied with if trade is wanted. The
willingness of the Germans to oblige in such matters largely
accounted for the rapid growth of their South American
trade. The Latin American business men are as acute and
intelligent as any. They know what they want and are
discriminating buyers as to quality and price.</p>

<p>Criticism of the shortcomings of the home office is the
second of the two forms previously referred to. Lack of
accuracy and of attention to details is a grievous fault, apparently
arising from want of discipline and thoroughness
in our homes and schools, a fault recognized by many
heads of offices here. The dishonesty of sending goods
inferior to sample or order, a practice injurious to the entire
national trade as well as to the guilty individual, shows an
utter lack of patriotism, as well as folly if permanent trade
is desired.</p>

<p>Another elementary matter is that of packing. Woful
tales of breakage and loss from bad packing have been rife
for years, and volumes have been written and spoken concerning
it. In 1916 an experienced traveling man told me
that before his last trip, in view of war conditions, he had
taken on the agency of some new people and received many
orders for them. He had sent explicit instructions as to
packing and other export details. But now he found his
new customers swearing mad and was booking no more
orders for his new patrons: for they had paid not the slightest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</span>
heed to his directions either as to packing or forwarding,
with disastrous results. In February, 1919, a letter
from Brazil said: “We cannot imagine why your shippers
ever accepted the travesty of an export bale dumped on
you by the spinners, and we must clearly state that our
factory will not accept any yarns which arrive in bad condition
due to bad packing.”</p>

<p>Unwillingness to profit by the knowledge and experience
of others, the belief that one knows everything without
learning anything, is called a peculiarly American trait,
though happily it is not universal. The British not only
pack and handle goods in the best manner, but they are
careful to send and land them in all parts of the world by
the best route and with the least expense to the receiver,
as the world knows. Of course we can do the same if we
take the trouble. The packing department for the soldiers
overseas showed the highest excellence. The baling of
clothes instead of boxing saved labor, box material, and
two thirds of the space, and goods arrived in better condition.
Fifty-five million dollars were saved at one plant in
a year. Forty-nine million dollars of this was cargo space,
other things were rent, freight, etc. Fifty-eight million feet
of lumber of 30 years growth were spared. The burlap
required would be useful in South America. Square packages
instead of round are advantageous. Those who wish
a share in foreign trade must take the pains to do everything
right. The most careful man, familiar with the metric
system, should be in charge. The scales should show pounds
and kilograms, and figures be given for net weight, container,
etc. Aside from careful packing to avoid breakage
or other injury as from water, dampness, or pilfering, instructions
are often given as to size and weight of package.
Mules, donkeys, and llamas usually carry two packages,
one on each side; the ordinary load of each is 200, 150, and
100 lbs. respectively, though some mules will take 300 lbs.
for a moderate distance. For the interior, especially on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</span>
North and West Coasts and in some sections on the East,
these animals are the only means of transport, and goods
must be packed accordingly; machinery in sections, etc.
Many boxes of 1000 pounds weight have been left on the
dock or at a railway station, the goods a total loss.</p>

<p>To arrange the packing with an eye to the custom house
is important, both in order that the contents may be easily
examined, and so that fines or exorbitant imposts may be
avoided. Directions and governmental regulations as to
giving separate weight of container and goods, and the
separation of different classes of the latter must be scrupulously
followed. Heavy fines are often imposed for trivial
errors in packing or invoice, and corrections of any mistakes
by cable are expensive if frequent.</p>

<p>Obligations of every kind should be fulfilled with fidelity
though a bad bargain has been made resulting in financial
loss. On the other hand consideration for the embarrassments
of the buyer should be shown, whether these are
purely personal or the result of national conditions such
as followed the outbreak of the War or the conclusion of
the Armistice. After the unexpected cessation of War
many orders which had been placed here were suddenly
cancelled under the supposition that coöperation such as
had always been extended by European merchants would
not be refused here. British representatives promptly
<i>offered</i> to cancel orders for goods that the buyers might
not care to receive under the changed circumstances, while
the majority of Americans made many difficulties: a contrast
in conduct liable to influence unfavorably future trade,
especially when added to the fact that vast numbers here
cancelled orders and that the average American manufacturer
had taken advantage of the situation created by the
War to charge exorbitant prices in excess of those applying
to domestic trade. Thus some manufacturers who have cried
out about the bad faith of the South Americans, with no
consideration for their difficulties, have forfeited their confidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</span>
and friendship, with a probable loss of future trade
unless able to offer remarkably attractive bargains.</p>

<p>The utmost care should be taken in the shipping of goods
as well as in the packing. Promptness is an important
feature. Where regular sailings occur space should be
engaged in advance, and the necessary papers accurately
made out in good season, in view of the many copies of the
consular invoices, the bills of lading, the clearance papers,
and the short hours of some of the consulates. To avoid the
trouble of attending to these and other elaborate details,
many manufacturers find it convenient to employ a Freight
Forwarder who looks after such matters including insurance
of various kinds covering theft, damage, and total loss. He
will know the most favorable trade routes, look after transfer
and storage, and fill all requirements, if qualified for
his job.</p>

<p>No dealings should be initiated in any country until
after the registration of patents and trademarks.</p>

<p>Trouble should be taken to adjust any <i>bona fide</i> complaint
and to satisfy reasonable customers. On account of
length of time and distance, especial pains should be taken
to avoid possible difficulty or disagreement.</p>

<p>The establishing of American banks in South America
has been a boon to manufacturers. The houses of Dun and
of Bradstreet perform much service for their clients in the
line of credit information. It has been suggested that the
Government might collect information for general private
use. It may be said that experience shows losses in foreign
trade to be less than in domestic. Yet, as shysters exist
everywhere, suitable precaution should be exercised, guarantees
required, or the reliability of the house made certain.</p>

<p>The use of the trade acceptance, a negotiable note given
by the purchaser to the seller of goods, now becoming
general, is of great assistance to those who were deterred
from entering South American trade on account of the long
credits which seemed necessary. Foreign bankers invest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</span>
in the commercial bills of other countries, knowing them
to be convertible into cash in those countries. Private
houses handling investments or commercial paper have
added departments for dealing in acceptances. The subject
of foreign exchange should be familiar, the fluctuations having
an important bearing on purchasing power and trade,
while exchange itself is dependent on foreign trade conditions,
being an index of international transactions. Careful
consideration of this matter is necessary in quoting prices.
In normal times it was customary on English imports to
reckon the pound as $4.90, and in export as $4.80 to cover
incidental expenses.</p>

<p>In certain lines, for example, in hand-made goods, it
is impossible for this country to face European or Asiatic
competition. In some kinds of machine-made goods we
excel. In lines where competition seems difficult the excellent
suggestion has been made that costs may be reduced.
The lowering of the daily wage has in some cases occurred;
and more may be accomplished by diminishing overhead
expense. The high salaries of the heads and of numerous
assistants in plants of moderate size and the expenses of
salesmen are often unnecessarily large, giving rise to foolish
and injurious extravagance, which indeed has permeated
all classes of society. Carnegie while building up his Steel
Company, and President McKinley smoked cigars costing
five cents each, while some modern salesmen pay 50
cents for one, with other things in proportion. Some hotels
charge 40 cents for a potato not costing one; a Washington
hotel asks 60 cents for a slice of watermelon when a whole
one is selling on the street for 15 cents. The head of a
company suggests that by reducing one-third of the personal
and family expenses for luxuries they will live longer and
be happier; that one-third of the middle men might be
cut out; that the office and supervising class could accomplish
25 per cent more and cut down office expenses one-third;
that the laboring man could increase his efficiency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</span>
and output one-third without injury and come nearer to
earning his wages; and that the unreasonable waste of
material should be diminished. I would however add that
many heads of establishments and departments work harder
and more hours than the ordinary office force or laborer.</p>

<p>One would naturally desire to have his firm name on
such goods as permit this; “Made in U.S.A.” seems desirable
where practicable. It has happened that Germans
handling American machinery have covered such marks
with their own. It may be noted that in South America
many of the large mercantile establishments of various
kinds, dry goods and others, are in the hands of British or
German firms. A considerable portion of trade in the large
cities is conducted by other than the native born.</p>

<p>For the best development of our foreign trade it is necessary
that young men entering this field should be of higher
type than the average in domestic affairs, particularly those
who will go to foreign lands. The larger number may not
be called upon to go outside of their town or country, as
many must be engaged in the export department, at the
factory or the seaport, or in commission houses and banks,
as export agents or freight forwarders, etc. Others will go
abroad as salesmen on tours, or to reside a few or many
years in the capacity of local agents, in branch houses of
large companies, civil and mining engineers, etc.</p>

<p>Many of both sexes have enough of the spirit of adventure
to enjoy the prospect of at least a temporary residence
in another land. It is to be hoped that those who desire the
broader career will enter it not solely for the pecuniary
reward but with something of the spirit which animated our
soldiers, the knowledge that they may extend the prestige
of their country and uphold the best traditions of democracy;
with the feeling that their work, if well done, is
patriotic in character, an essential and splendid vocation,
a dignified career for the development of the commerce
and the promotion of the welfare of a great nation. Character,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</span>
the manners of a gentleman, and educational preparation
are among the requisite qualifications. Of prime necessity
is a familiarity with one or two foreign languages;
also a training that will develop thoroughness and accuracy
and the consciousness that these are essential. Nothing
will accomplish this better than a good groundwork of
Latin; which makes mere play the acquisition of any
derived language like Spanish, French, or Portuguese. A
sound understanding of Latin syntax is needed for easy
comprehension of these languages, with their varied forms
and constructions, so different from our simple English,
which indeed one who is ignorant of any other language
hardly comprehends. The ability to conduct business correspondence
correctly and with at least some degree of
the elegance and courteous phraseology current in other
lands where our brusque letters and speech are disliked if
not resented: Knowledge of office routine especially as to
the various papers to be procured and prepared in connection
with foreign transactions: An acquaintance with the
requirements of shipping practices, trade routes, types of
vessels, freight rates, insurance of various kinds, loading
and unloading facilities at different ports, and details as to
the arrival and despatch of cargoes and vessels: A study
of the principles of commercial law needed to enable one
to decide business questions, disputes and misunderstandings,
according to equity and international practice: A close
study of the economic conditions which govern the production
of the countries, of the social institutions and customs,
of advertising needs and methods, of shipping facilities, of
banking facilities and methods, credit practices and requirements,
and any discrimination in tariffs or regulations:</p>

<p>A study of the foreign trade practices and methods of
those countries already occupying these markets, the character
and style of their goods and their methods of securing
and holding business: Acquaintance with the financial and
investment relations of other countries as affecting international<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</span>
trade; with foreign banking practices and with the
mechanism of foreign exchange: A study of physical
geography including the natural resources, climatic conditions,
and characteristic peculiarities of each country: A
knowledge of the history and affiliations of the countries,
with the character of their governments as likely to bear
on their commerce:—All these are matters which must not
be overlooked by any one who wishes to become an expert
in foreign trade. Some acquaintance with the racial origin
and relations of the nations, with their social customs,
religious tendencies, and traditions may at times help in
determining trade possibilities. It is important to realize
that the cultivation of tact, dignity, and judgment is necessary
for success as a foreign representative, and that such
an one may prove a more valuable ambassador than some
of those occupying such position, to whom a similar training
would be of advantage.</p>

<p>Furthermore we must realize that no nation can sell largely
abroad unless it buys also, and that we must purchase from
South America if we expect to sell there. Fortunately they
have many agricultural products, which we do not produce,
and other raw material of which we have not sufficient. Yet
probably we cannot take as much from them as we should
like to sell. <span class="smcap">We must</span> therefore <span class="allsmcap">INVEST</span>, now that we are a
creditor nation, in the securities of others, the bonds of the
countries and cities; we must send our capital to develop
public utilities where these are lacking, as for sewerage
and water supply. Electric lighting plants and power,
docks and railways, have proved excellent investments. The
better banking facilities now provided encourage these on
our part. The British, French, and Belgians have been
beforehand in this matter. The British have invested more
than two billions in Argentina, $1,200,000,000 in Brazil,
smaller sums in Uruguay and Chile. The Germans have
not invested much money, their banks bringing chiefly
credit and making money by taking part of the business of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span>
local banks, a practice not conducive to popularity. The
United States, i.e., some people, have invested $175,000,000
or more in Brazil, smaller sums in other countries. Large
opportunities lie open in this direction.</p>

<p>That loans should be made to foreign countries only on
condition that the money be spent <i>here</i>, seems a short-sighted
policy, as also restrictions on our export of gold, when our excessive
holding of that metal is a contributing cause of the
unfortunate exchange situation. Many Republics need railways,
for which construction material and equipment would
be here purchased if here financed; but part of the money
must be spent on the ground; so with works of irrigation
and other public or private construction. If we must always
be selfish, at least our selfishness should be enlightened, and
we should realize that in the long run we shall gain more
by manifesting a friendly spirit of service and coöperation
rather than by showing intense eagerness for the “mighty
dollar.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_LII">CHAPTER LII<br><span class="small">LIFE IN SOUTH AMERICA</span></h3>
</div>


<p>While the variety of conditions in South America makes
any treatment of this subject necessarily superficial, a few
words beyond those already said may not be out of place,
since it is evident that for the successful conduct of our
trade many persons from the United States must spend
some years or reside permanently in the several countries.
From the descriptions given one should have a fair idea as
to climatic conditions in these and make an intelligent
choice of locality if any is offered. Some persons will be
happy in warm Rio or even in more tropical Pará. Others will
prefer Andean heights, from 7000 to 14,000 feet altitude,
the higher for persons with sound hearts only. Most of the
cities where one is likely to be stationed have a fairly temperate
climate, and good health conditions, except as previously
indicated.</p>

<p>In respect to social advantages there is considerable
variety. In general the smaller the city the greater the
hospitality and the more will one’s society be cultivated,
as is true in the United States also. On the other hand
in the important commercial cities, the English-speaking
folk are numerous enough to make an agreeable society
for themselves, and some South Americans have made the
criticism that the English and Americans hold aloof,
apparently preferring their own company: a mistake from a
business point of view and also nationally. One must, however,
have the right qualifications for cordial recognition
anywhere. It has been stated of Buenos Aires that the
fact of membership in the diplomatic corps did not entitle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</span>
the gentleman and his family to more than official courtesies;
to be received socially he must be <i>persona grata</i>.
This is true to some extent everywhere. At the same time
one who is at the head of a large commercial establishment
is more likely to have social opportunities than members of
the office staff, one of whom, a young man of unusually good
manners and attractive personality complained to me in
Lima some years ago, that he had no social opportunities.
It is different now. On the other hand a young dentist in
a city of Argentina where Americans are few associated
with the best people and married into one of the first
families.</p>

<p>At the mining camps of the Americans provision is now
made for the social life of the employes and for exercise
and recreation, also by other large corporations. In general
I believe that men enjoy the life in South America better than
their wives. Some of the latter decline to go or to remain
after being there a while: a great mistake if they have any
regard for their husband’s welfare, unless the care of children
or other serious matter compels their return. Many
women are perfectly contented, this depending in some
degree on their location, but chiefly upon their disposition.
In the town of Sorata, Bolivia, I chanced to meet one who
seemed perfectly happy, though she was the only English
speaking woman in the place, or within 100 miles.</p>

<p>It is desirable for banks and business houses to give
their young men sufficient salaries to permit them to marry
and take their wives along. It will be better for both parties
in the long run. Perhaps there are no more temptations
than in our own large cities, but in most places there are
fewer forms of wholesome recreation. Too many men in
cities and in mining camps have gone to pieces as they
say.</p>

<p>Some men prefer life abroad for the reason that they
feel less restraint than in their native home or even in our
metropolis, rather than the responsibility which a real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</span>
patriot should recognize of presenting the highest American
ideals of manners, conduct, and business practices. If one
cannot be contented without going somewhere every night,
except in Rio or Buenos Aires he might be unhappy or
worse. It would be well if persons everywhere had sufficient
intelligence to enjoy themselves at home with a good
book, a quiet game of cards, even cribbage; but especially
books that are worth while, valuable as literature or as
containing information about the world in general or on
matters connected with business. “Movies” are found
almost everywhere; in the larger cities, theatres and a long
or short season of opera; clubs with opportunities for golf,
tennis, and other sports; often horse races. In smaller towns
horseback riding is a common, sometimes the chief diversion;
but in such places one sooner enters the social life
of the community. Some Americans say they would not
take a wife to such a place, but if she is wise she will go.</p>

<p>Punctiliousness in dress as well as in manners is more
highly regarded in South America than in the United States.
Evening dress is more general in large cities than in most
of ours, and correct afternoon dress for men is a more rigid
requirement. Some persons on important missions have
astonished the Latins by their negligence in this regard.
Of course a gentleman is a gentleman the world over and
such an one will have no trouble. It is unnecessary to
imitate certain mannerisms of many South Americans, yet
a little more effusiveness is easily acquired and may be an
improvement on the coldness of the Anglo Saxon. It will
be noticed that men regularly lift their hats to each other,
that they shake hands much oftener, when you come and
when you go, make more inquiries after your health, etc.
That they pat each other on the back, give mild hugs, or
at times kiss one another (not you), will perhaps not seem
so terrible as formerly, now that so much has been written
about brave marshals and generals kissing soldiers on both
cheeks when conferring decorations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</span></p>

<p>Courtesy must not be considered hypocrisy because
phrases like “The house is yours” mean no more than our
remarks “I am glad to see you” or “How are you?” though
we may wish the caller in Africa and have no real interest
in his health. Not everywhere is the same courtesy evident.
On my first visit to La Paz in 1903 I noticed that men
frequently stepped from the narrow sidewalk into the gutter
to allow a lady to pass. More recently in a much larger
city, still with some narrow sidewalks, I frequently stepped
into the street myself to avoid crowding past a gentleman (?)
who made no move to give way.</p>

<p>The cost of living is an item of practical interest. Some
remarks on this subject have seemed to me exaggerated.
Great diversity exists in this respect in the different cities:
the larger the more expensive, as in the world generally.
In most of the capital cities and chief ports rents are high;
in some places many articles of food are dear with others
cheap; similarly with dry goods and other articles, some
higher than in New York, others lower. Recent unusual
conditions have made sudden changes which may be repeated.
Living expenses were increased by the War, and
on account of the influx of foreigners for business houses.
In 1916 rents in Buenos Aires were lowered in the business
centre; but they have now advanced to their former price
or higher. Years ago one of our diplomats there paid more
for his house rent than his entire salary on which others
perhaps have managed to live.</p>

<p>In remote sections, for instance in the Huailas Valley,
Peru, in 1906, a sheep cost $1, a lamb 40 cents, a chicken
15 cents, beefsteak, 9 cents a pound. The cook received
$1.50 a month and board. Fresh fruit and vegetables were
almost given away. In Lima then as now it was very
different, some kinds of food were expensive, others cheap.
Coal and kerosene oil are dear everywhere except in the
Huailas Valley where coal is abundant with no market.
In Buenos Aires a few apartment houses and hotels have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</span>
hot water heating, but in many places in winter one freezes,
or uses an oil stove or an electric heater, the former the
cheaper and more effective.</p>

<p>Persons of adaptable disposition may spend a few years
in South America with pleasure and profit, returning with
broader minds, and with the ability to command higher
salaries than if they had remained at home.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="APPENDIX_I">APPENDIX I<br><span class="small">POSTAL REGULATIONS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Much repetition is avoided and probably greater convenience
secured by presenting a summary of the Postal
Regulations. All of the South American Republics are members
of the Postal Union. In November, 1920, a Pan American
Postal Federation was formed. According to the convention
adopted, <i>domestic rates</i> will apply to letters, postal cards, and
printed matter, among the various countries of Latin
America and the United States, as soon as they have ratified
the agreement. At present, October, 1921, this has been
done by the United States and by the South American
Republics, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.
To these the letter rate is two cents, postal cards, one cent,
return cards two cents; printed matter, newspapers and
periodicals, one cent for four ounces. The old rates now effective
in the other countries will doubtless soon be reduced,
and should therefore be investigated.</p>

<p>Parcel post service has been extended so that parcels
weighing up to 22 pounds may be sent to Argentina, Brazil,
Colombia, Paraguay, and Peru. To Ecuador 20 pounds is
the limit; to Bolivia, Chile, British, Dutch, and French
Guiana, Uruguay, and Venezuela, 11 pounds is the maximum.
The rate to all is 12 cents a pound or a fraction
thereof; except that to Paraguay, on account of transit
through Argentina, 30 cents additional must be paid for a
parcel weighing 11 pounds or less, and 60 cents for one
above that to 22 pounds. In Brazil, this service is limited
to Bahia, Bello Horizonte, Curityba, Manaos, Pará, Pelotas,
Pernambuco, Porto Alegre, Rio de Janeiro (including<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</span>
Petropolis), Rio Grande do Sul, and São Paulo. Parcels
are subject to customs duties, and these with other details
should be investigated. Parcels may be registered for
Bolivia, Brazil, British Guiana, Chile, Ecuador, Peru,
Venezuela, but not for the other countries.</p>

<p>Money orders may be sent to Peru, Bolivia, and
Uruguay.</p>

<p>Changes resulting from the Pan American Postal Congress
at Buenos Aires in 1921 will be inaugurated January,
1923 or earlier.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Cable Facilities</span></h4>

<p>On the North Coast, Cartagena has direct cable connection
with Colon and so with New York. To Puerto Colombia a
cable has been laid, which, however, December, 1921, has
not yet been opened. A French company has a line
from Salinas near Pará to Cayenne, Paramaribo, and
Martinique, another from La Guaira, to Curaçao, and Santo
Domingo. The Venezuelan Government has its own cable
along the coast from Maracaibo, to La Guaira, Barcelona,
and other points. A British line connects Georgetown,
Guiana, with the Port of Spain, Trinidad.</p>

<p>The West Coast is connected with North America by
three lines of the All America system: one from Nicaragua
and two from Panamá to Santa Elena, Ecuador, one of the
latter by way of Buenaventura and Esmeraldas. The three
lines continue south to Callao, one touching at Paita. Two
go on to Iquique and Valparaiso, one touching at Antofagasta,
while a branch comes north from Iquique to Arica
to make connection with La Paz. A cable of another company
from Callao touches at Mollendo, Arica, Antofagasta,
La Serena, Valparaiso, and Concepción.</p>

<p>The East Coast is connected with the cables of the West
Coast by three private wires of the All America Cables
over the Andes from Valparaiso to Buenos Aires, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</span>
they can handle messages to the Argentine metropolis, 7452
miles from New York, by automatic methods in 15 minutes.
Another cable company has a land line from Valparaiso
to La Plata, where connection is made with its Trans-Atlantic
cable to Africa and Europe. Both companies have
short lines to Montevideo, the focus of the East Coast lines.
From here the All America has a cable to Santos and one
to Rio de Janeiro. The other, the Western Telegraph, has
one to Chuy, Uruguay, thence to Rio Grande do Sul, Santa
Catharina, Santos, Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco,
Fortaleza, Maranhão, and Pará, Brazil; and one from Chuy
direct to Rio de Janeiro and Pernambuco. Four cables
from the latter port connect with Africa and Europe. The
Western Telegraph was to lay a cable from Maranhão to
Barbados, there to connect with the Western Union line to
Florida. The All America expects to lay a cable from Cuba
south to Rio de Janeiro. The Amazon Company has a cable
up that river from Pará.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Metric System</span></h4>

<p>The Metric System of weights and measures is legal
and official in all the Republics and obligatory in most, in
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela.
In the other countries and in some of these, the old Spanish
measures (Portuguese in Brazil) are more or less used,
but these differ in the various countries and are nowhere
like ours. Always to employ the metric system is highly
important and in the above mentioned countries necessary,
though for shipping to some, the weight in pounds must also
be given. In Chile the use of other weights and measures
is prohibited; also in Uruguay, where their importation is
forbidden.</p>
